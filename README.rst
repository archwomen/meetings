Meetings
=============

Agendas and Notes from Arch Women IRC meetings and IRC logs.

see: https://archwomen.org/wiki/meetings:how_meetings_are_run

The logs are plain text and record all the topics and ideas discussed at 
IRC meetings held by Arch Linux Women. The meetings generally have an agenda 
that is followed along with open discussion. The agenda and decisions made on
agenda items are kept in the meeting notes.

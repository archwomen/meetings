2013-03-03 11:10:51            fsckd   lol
2013-03-03 11:11:03      KylieBrooks   hello folks 
2013-03-03 11:11:06            Sarah   About CMS stuff, I've been using django-cms at "work", it's pretty neat.
2013-03-03 11:11:18          yardena   are we still going with mezzanine?
2013-03-03 11:11:29            fsckd   yardena: that seems to be the plan so far
2013-03-03 11:11:56          yardena   awesome
2013-03-03 11:12:54      KylieBrooks   so it seems we are almost done or done discussing regarding the blog. are we moving onto security?
2013-03-03 11:13:17            Sarah   :c
2013-03-03 11:13:39          yardena   your call KylieBrooks 
2013-03-03 11:13:40        +tigrmesh   any other comments/suggestions/volunteers?
2013-03-03 11:14:10            fsckd   KylieBrooks has the power :D
2013-03-03 11:14:12                *   yardena intended all along to help with mezzanine but has been too busy
2013-03-03 11:14:24      KylieBrooks   if nothng else regarding this agenda item in 5 minutes we wiull move onto security.
2013-03-03 11:15:10        KaiSforza   (sidenote: is it just me, or did titanpad die?)
2013-03-03 11:15:35            fsckd   KaiSforza: it's a little shaky sometimes but it's alive atm
2013-03-03 11:15:43        KaiSforza   okay. carry on.
2013-03-03 11:17:16      KylieBrooks   so, i think the consenus so far is for us to stay withh mezzanine. 
2013-03-03 11:17:55            fsckd   i guess so
2013-03-03 11:18:52      KylieBrooks   okay, so moving onto security now 
2013-03-03 11:19:21      KylieBrooks   Security - intrusion detection as said on the meeting page.
2013-03-03 11:20:03      KylieBrooks   5 minutes for everyone to discuss/comment
2013-03-03 11:20:04          yardena   any intruders so far?
2013-03-03 11:20:14                *   fsckd has no idea
2013-03-03 11:20:45            fsckd   we upgraded redmine to the latest... which closed some importnat holes there
2013-03-03 11:21:04          yardena   software upgrades are always fun
2013-03-03 11:21:10            fsckd   there has been a lot of attempts on the site according to the logs
2013-03-03 11:21:37            fsckd   on the main domain, i don't know what's happened on the subdomains
2013-03-03 11:21:38        +tigrmesh   does anyone here know how to tell?  and would they be willing to mentor one of us?  and/or do the server monitoring themselves?
2013-03-03 11:21:41          yardena   seemed like typical brute force attacks for any server
2013-03-03 11:21:56        +tigrmesh   or know someone who'd be willing to do that?
2013-03-03 11:22:30            Sarah   Doesn't SSH have connection logs?
2013-03-03 11:22:36            Sarah   And Apache/webservers.
2013-03-03 11:22:43            Sarah   They provide IPs as well, etc.
2013-03-03 11:22:54            fsckd   yes, that's how we know there are attempts
2013-03-03 11:23:18   CalimeroTeknik   is fail2ban in place? for ssh bruteforcing and maybe http bans
2013-03-03 11:23:20            fsckd   fyi we're using lighttpd
2013-03-03 11:23:28            Sarah   Ban those IPs globally?
2013-03-03 11:23:44            fsckd   not sure if that's a good idea
2013-03-03 11:24:16            fsckd   ssh is fairly secure from direct attacks as it's passwordless
2013-03-03 11:24:28      KylieBrooks   okay, so is think since the relevant person isn't here atm, we can put security and resource monitoring on the agenda for next meeting.
2013-03-03 11:24:41            fsckd   ok
2013-03-03 11:24:46          yardena   there is no relevant person afaik
2013-03-03 11:25:08        +tigrmesh   what do you mean, the relevant person isn't here?  we need a relevant person
2013-03-03 11:25:17            fsckd   meskarune is setting up some resource monitoring stuff and is working on security
2013-03-03 11:25:19            fsckd   stuff
2013-03-03 11:25:22      KylieBrooks   ^
2013-03-03 11:25:23        +tigrmesh   ah
2013-03-03 11:25:29        +tigrmesh   ok
2013-03-03 11:25:46      KylieBrooks   SO, next sagenda item
2013-03-03 11:26:06      KylieBrooks   skipping resource monitoring
2013-03-03 11:26:22      KylieBrooks   ok, status on redmine, git repositories, calendar, news ?
2013-03-03 11:26:40            fsckd   right, as i said earlier, redmine was upgraded
2013-03-03 11:26:55      KylieBrooks   probably 5 to 10 minutes to discuss. more likely 5 minutes. go on.
2013-03-03 11:26:55            fsckd   that closed a really big security hole that hit rails
2013-03-03 11:27:32            fsckd   news item for that is http://redmine.archwomen.org/news/6
2013-03-03 11:27:34            phrik   Title: Redmine upgraded - Server Administration - Arch Linux Women: Project Manager (at redmine.archwomen.org)
2013-03-03 11:27:57            fsckd   for git repositories, we're moving more and more of stuff to be managed through git
2013-03-03 11:28:14                *   yardena applauds
2013-03-03 11:28:17            fsckd   you can see the repos on github
2013-03-03 11:28:42            fsckd   https://github.com/archwomen
2013-03-03 11:28:43            phrik   Title: archwomen (Arch Linux Women Project) Â· GitHub (at github.com)
2013-03-03 11:28:50            fsckd   anyone can make pull requests
2013-03-03 11:29:17            fsckd   server admins can deploy by pushing changes to the server
2013-03-03 11:30:14            fsckd   i'm thinking of setting up teams on github for the various parts of the site, so anyone with interest can ask and will be added to that team with push access to the associated repos
2013-03-03 11:31:26      KylieBrooks   good idea fsckd :)
2013-03-03 11:31:36            fsckd   yeah :)
2013-03-03 11:32:16            fsckd   people who want to help with the server stuff can start doing so
2013-03-03 11:32:38            fsckd   the placeholder site is on github too
2013-03-03 11:32:44            Sarah   fsckd, grammar error on the git repo. "Official logo's of Archwomen" should be "Official Logos of Archwomen"
2013-03-03 11:33:02            fsckd   Sarah: thanks, i'll fix that :)
2013-03-03 11:33:57      KylieBrooks   any other comments/suggestions/volunteers?
2013-03-03 11:34:14            Sarah   I can contribute to the site
2013-03-03 11:34:51            fsckd   Sarah: that will be great :)
2013-03-03 11:35:00            Sarah   But I need to know what to do
2013-03-03 11:35:01        +tigrmesh   one moment
2013-03-03 11:35:54        +tigrmesh   if anyone has some news related to arch women or women in tech
2013-03-03 11:36:31        +tigrmesh   that they want to share, please let me, yardena, meskarune or fsckd know
2013-03-03 11:36:48        +tigrmesh   also, if you think a project needs a news update, let us know
2013-03-03 11:37:05        +tigrmesh   so we can put it on redmine
2013-03-03 11:38:00        +tigrmesh   also, maybe not related to this item (i was afk), the placeholder page has been updated
2013-03-03 11:38:28          yardena   tl;dr we're slowly chugging along to having a working site again
2013-03-03 11:38:43            fsckd   indeed XD
2013-03-03 11:39:15        +tigrmesh   Sarah: that's awesome.  thanks  :)
2013-03-03 11:39:36        +tigrmesh   one of us will get with you 
2013-03-03 11:40:45            Sarah   Essentially, all that needs to be done is a recursive checklist.
2013-03-03 11:41:40            Sarah   As in
2013-03-03 11:41:48            Sarah   A list of things to do sorted in categories.
2013-03-03 11:42:39      KylieBrooks   just to clarify, Sarah, what site work are you  doing?
2013-03-03 11:42:54      KylieBrooks   (this is for meeting notes/minutes)
2013-03-03 11:43:09            Sarah   Uh
2013-03-03 11:43:15            Sarah   Elaborate the question, please.
2013-03-03 11:43:38      KylieBrooks   How are  you planning on contributing to the site?
2013-03-03 11:43:50            Sarah   Oh
2013-03-03 11:44:14            Sarah   I don't know yet. I can help with coding the Python Django stuff. (We're still going with that, right?)
2013-03-03 11:44:33            fsckd   yeah, i'll let numeral know
2013-03-03 11:44:34          yardena   that would be really helpful Sarah, thanks
2013-03-03 11:45:01      KylieBrooks   okay, recorded in minutes - thanks
2013-03-03 11:45:01            fsckd   and meskarune
2013-03-03 11:45:45        +tigrmesh   when you say recursive checklist, do you mean something like a list of monthly tasks like: update chan topic 3 weeks ahead; update twitter 1 week, then 1 hour ahead; open a titanpad ?
2013-03-03 11:46:31        KaiSforza   it's a checklist for a checklist that is a checklist for the first checklist.
2013-03-03 11:46:33        +tigrmesh   something more extensive and technical, of course.  but my imagination is limited today
2013-03-03 11:46:51        KaiSforza   because someone heard you like checklists.
2013-03-03 11:47:11        +tigrmesh   oh.  and i was thinking of a regenerative checklist
2013-03-03 11:47:16        +tigrmesh   nvm
2013-03-03 11:47:30                *   KaiSforza has no idea honestly
2013-03-03 11:47:31            Sarah   tigrmesh, no, I mean http://pastie.org/6371849
2013-03-03 11:47:32            phrik   Title: #6371849 - Pastie (at pastie.org)
2013-03-03 11:47:47        KaiSforza   Sarah: so a checklist.
2013-03-03 11:47:47            Sarah   Like
2013-03-03 11:47:49            Sarah   Yeah
2013-03-03 11:47:54        KaiSforza   with sublevels.
2013-03-03 11:47:55            Sarah   But not linear, it needs layers.
2013-03-03 11:48:03        +tigrmesh   gotcha
2013-03-03 11:48:16      KylieBrooks   okay
2013-03-03 11:48:22        KaiSforza   s/recursive/layered/
2013-03-03 11:48:23        +tigrmesh   Sarah:  thanks for the visual.  i understand now
2013-03-03 11:48:28            Sarah   :)
2013-03-03 11:48:30      KylieBrooks   so, looks like we are almost done discussing 
2013-03-03 11:48:49            fsckd   news seems to be up, http://news.archwomen.org/
2013-03-03 11:48:50            phrik   Title: Arch Women News (at news.archwomen.org)
2013-03-03 11:49:15            fsckd   calendar is not
2013-03-03 11:49:27            fsckd   i don't know how it'll be done
2013-03-03 11:50:10        +tigrmesh   if anyone is willing to research redmine calendar platforms, that would be great
2013-03-03 11:50:41        +tigrmesh   that way we could have the calendar integrated
2013-03-03 11:51:02      KylieBrooks   so, after that task is assigned, we can go onto the projects to be discussed now, or meeting date to be set: classrooms, internship, channel rules.
2013-03-03 11:51:18            fsckd   yup
2013-03-03 11:51:21        KaiSforza   Just to have something in the minutes: there's going to be an archlinux-classroom meeting at 1800 UTC, and gtmanfred and I will be setting up a PKGBUILD class tuesday, at 2015 UTC. If anyone wants to help, just join #archlinux-classroom
2013-03-03 11:51:41            fsckd   A+
2013-03-03 11:51:43        +tigrmesh   awesome
2013-03-03 11:51:44        KaiSforza   my job is done.
2013-03-03 11:51:48            fsckd   haha
2013-03-03 11:52:11      KylieBrooks   ok, so classroom being put into minutes...
2013-03-03 11:52:46        KaiSforza   just a note about the class, it won't actually be happening at 2015UTC, it'll just be getting set up. We're going to wait till pacman 4.1 hits [testing] to do teaching, methinks.
2013-03-03 11:52:58        +tigrmesh   k
2013-03-03 11:53:02            fsckd   sounds good
2013-03-03 11:53:14        KaiSforza   so it'll probably be a more normal time for you europeans out there.
2013-03-03 11:53:16      KylieBrooks   lol wtf just happened.
2013-03-03 11:53:24            Sarah   ^^
2013-03-03 11:53:36            fsckd   KylieBrooks: where?
2013-03-03 11:53:37        +tigrmesh   one other thing.  there was a request to make redmine use only nicks and not real names.  that
2013-03-03 11:53:41        KaiSforza   eh?
2013-03-03 11:53:48      KylieBrooks   fsckd: firefocx closed on me 
2013-03-03 11:53:52      KylieBrooks   but im good now
2013-03-03 11:54:00            fsckd   oh ok
2013-03-03 11:54:22        KaiSforza   tigrmesh: also...it doesn't seem like your msmtp/imap stuff is set up for redmine. I requested a password reset, but haven't gotten any emails or anything.
2013-03-03 11:54:28        +tigrmesh   's not possible.  sign up for redmine using your nick / nick as first and last name if you don't want your real name out there
2013-03-03 11:54:45        +tigrmesh   KaiSforza: k
2013-03-03 11:55:35            fsckd   KaiSforza: yeah... haven't set up email with redmine yet
2013-03-03 11:55:39        +tigrmesh   KaiSforza: would you be willing to submit that as an issue on the redmine project on redmine?
2013-03-03 11:55:41        KaiSforza   :<
2013-03-03 11:55:57            fsckd   lol, he can't sign in it seems
2013-03-03 11:56:03        KaiSforza   tigrmesh: can i without signing in?
2013-03-03 11:56:09        +tigrmesh   no
2013-03-03 11:56:14        KaiSforza   lol then no
2013-03-03 11:56:27            fsckd   KaiSforza: we'll fix you after the meeting
2013-03-03 11:56:32        KaiSforza   well, i'd be willing, just not able.
2013-03-03 11:56:36        KaiSforza   fsckd: thanks
2013-03-03 11:56:37        +tigrmesh   hehe
2013-03-03 11:56:39            fsckd   fix your account*
2013-03-03 11:56:47      KylieBrooks   so, what about internship and channel rules?
2013-03-03 11:58:07        +tigrmesh   titanpad is amazing.  2 people are updating at the same, and it shows
2013-03-03 11:58:11            fsckd   haha
2013-03-03 11:59:49            fsckd   the proposal was to create a paid internship for women interested in FOSS
2013-03-03 12:00:28            fsckd   with Arch Linux
2013-03-03 12:00:37            fsckd   project page on redmine, http://redmine.archwomen.org/projects/internship
2013-03-03 12:00:39            phrik   Title: Overview - Internship - Arch Linux Women: Project Manager (at redmine.archwomen.org)
2013-03-03 12:01:21            fsckd   in a previous meeting there were a couple of ideas on how it could be done
2013-03-03 12:01:44            fsckd   could make one from scratch
2013-03-03 12:02:08            fsckd   another is to get Arch Linux to join the program lead by Gnome
2013-03-03 12:03:23            fsckd   i favor the second
2013-03-03 12:03:47        +tigrmesh   what about google summer of code?
2013-03-03 12:04:11            fsckd   that too i guess... is it paid?
2013-03-03 12:04:24        +tigrmesh   working on an arch linux project?
2013-03-03 12:04:31            fsckd   yeah
2013-03-03 12:04:41        +tigrmesh   i think it is, at least some
2013-03-03 12:05:08      KylieBrooks   some money, you mean?
2013-03-03 12:05:19            fsckd   or could do the gnome and google things together
2013-03-03 12:05:33        +tigrmesh   gnome is paid too?
2013-03-03 12:05:36            fsckd   need to know what obligation al would have
2013-03-03 12:05:50            fsckd   yeah, i don't know who funds it though
2013-03-03 12:06:17            fsckd   before we propose it to al, we need to do research, that'll be the task of a-w
2013-03-03 12:07:06        +tigrmesh   anyone willing to research whether those 2 internships are paid and what's needed to get them?
2013-03-03 12:07:24        +tigrmesh   never mind.  i'll do that one
2013-03-03 12:07:26          jy2wong   tigrmesh: google summer of code is paid.
2013-03-03 12:07:32        +tigrmesh   thanks  :)
2013-03-03 12:07:33          jy2wong   tigrmesh: ~$2000 or so iirc
2013-03-03 12:07:43        +tigrmesh   for 8 weeks?
2013-03-03 12:07:49        +tigrmesh   or 12?
2013-03-03 12:08:07          jy2wong   3 months I wanna say.
2013-03-03 12:08:23        +tigrmesh   k
2013-03-03 12:08:25            fsckd   gnome one is https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen

2013-03-03 12:08:57      KylieBrooks   will need a link for gsoc to put n minutes please?
2013-03-03 12:09:38          jy2wong   oh, wait: Google will provide a total stipend of 5500 USD per accepted student developer, of which 5000 USD goes to the student and 500 USD goes to the mentoring organization.

2013-03-03 12:10:54          jy2wong   also, GSoC is indeed a 3 month thing.
2013-03-03 12:11:18          jy2wong   what sorts of things would an arch linux internship entail?
2013-03-03 12:12:09            fsckd   a dev could answer that best
2013-03-03 12:12:24            fsckd   i think it would involve working on projects https://projects.archlinux.org/
2013-03-03 12:12:25            phrik   Title: Arch Linux Projects (at projects.archlinux.org)
2013-03-03 12:12:32        KaiSforza   hacking the poop out of pacman
2013-03-03 12:12:40            fsckd   haha that ^
2013-03-03 12:12:46      KylieBrooks   so can we discuss that at the next meeting?
2013-03-03 12:12:53            fsckd   i guess so
2013-03-03 12:13:15            Sarah   !grab KaiSforza 
2013-03-03 12:13:17            phrik   Sarah: Tada!
2013-03-03 12:13:30      KylieBrooks   anymore things to discuss regarding internship?
2013-03-03 12:13:56        +tigrmesh   it also involves talking arch linux devs into it.  as far as i know, they've never had a gsoc intern
2013-03-03 12:14:48   CalimeroTeknik   there are no arch linux facilities whatsoever, I think
2013-03-03 12:14:57        +tigrmesh   don't rely on that information.  the last time i looked that up was in 2010, i think
2013-03-03 12:15:31        KaiSforza   we could always just talk to falconindy.
2013-03-03 12:15:39        +tigrmesh   CalimeroTeknik: what do you mean?
2013-03-03 12:18:54        +tigrmesh   KaiSforza: true
2013-03-03 12:19:43      KylieBrooks   I will wait forr CalimeroTeknik to finish their contribution and then soon after that, we need to discuss channel rules or set a meeting date for that.
2013-03-03 12:21:43            fsckd   he's away :/
2013-03-03 12:22:23        KaiSforza   fsckd: who is?
2013-03-03 12:22:24   CalimeroTeknik   sorry, I meant "interns" for arch linux are er, not on site.
2013-03-03 12:22:36            fsckd   KaiSforza: no more :)
2013-03-03 12:22:42        KaiSforza   lol
2013-03-03 12:23:08      KylieBrooks   CalimeroTeknik: not on site as in... ?
2013-03-03 12:23:27   CalimeroTeknik   in the "enterprise" 's premises or so
2013-03-03 12:23:50        +tigrmesh   that doesn't matter for GSoC
2013-03-03 12:23:59        +tigrmesh   i don't think for gnome either
2013-03-03 12:24:02   CalimeroTeknik   but that was maybe stupid or so. don't mind me, I'm just making remarks that might help (or not, here, probably)
2013-03-03 12:24:11            fsckd   gnome's thing is also done in remote
2013-03-03 12:25:09        abveritas   for GSoC internship paid amounts, I'll ask our 2 team members who participated last years, as soon as they come in IRC
2013-03-03 12:25:23        abveritas   *year
2013-03-03 12:25:33            fsckd   thanks abveritas :)
2013-03-03 12:26:28      KylieBrooks   so, channel rules it seems we should discuss now
2013-03-03 12:27:15            fsckd   perhaps schedule a meeting for that
2013-03-03 12:27:27      KylieBrooks   k, good idea 
2013-03-03 12:27:33      KylieBrooks   thoughts about when?
2013-03-03 12:27:51            fsckd   i think yardena may want to take part in this :)
2013-03-03 12:28:08      KylieBrooks   yardena: hi, you there?
2013-03-03 12:29:33            fsckd   i propose 17th or 24th
2013-03-03 12:29:53            fsckd   or 10th

2013-03-03 12:31:54        abveritas   it is $5k for 3 months
2013-03-03 12:32:03        abveritas   GSoC
2013-03-03 12:32:09        KaiSforza   wow
2013-03-03 12:32:24        +tigrmesh   thank you abveritas  :)
2013-03-03 12:32:34        abveritas   you're welcome
2013-03-03 12:32:34      KylieBrooks   yardena: idle fo 30 minutes so far. doesnt matter which day for me, fsckd. any others have inputy on which day they want a meeting for channel rules?
2013-03-03 12:33:55            fsckd   i'm going to say 10th 16:00 UTC cause i want it done soon
2013-03-03 12:34:02        +tigrmesh   i say we set a date for now and reset it (and re announce it) if yardena and/or whoever else wants to participate is not available then
2013-03-03 12:34:20      KylieBrooks   reset what, specifically?
2013-03-03 12:34:24      KylieBrooks   oh 
2013-03-03 12:34:26      KylieBrooks   nvm
2013-03-03 12:34:27        +tigrmesh   the meeting
2013-03-03 12:34:30      KylieBrooks   i get it
2013-03-03 12:34:31        +tigrmesh   and 10th is good for me
2013-03-03 12:35:07        +tigrmesh   i was lazy when i typed it  ;)
2013-03-03 12:35:12      KylieBrooks   so, the meeting for chaannel rules next sunday at 16:00 UTC 
2013-03-03 12:35:17      KylieBrooks   the 10th
2013-03-03 12:36:24        +tigrmesh   cool
2013-03-03 12:37:04      KylieBrooks   okay, so just wanted to bring up my meeting feedback.
2013-03-03 12:37:15            fsckd   sure :)
2013-03-03 12:37:37      KylieBrooks   seems like some of us didn't know who was discussing what from the meeting page. next A-W meeting needs to have that addeed.
2013-03-03 12:38:00            fsckd   ok, like hints on who is the expert on th etopic?
2013-03-03 12:38:02      KylieBrooks   also,  i'm not sure what we should do about people that come in during the meeting. 
2013-03-03 12:38:06      KylieBrooks   right fsckd 
2013-03-03 12:39:05      KylieBrooks   also,  tigrmesh had mentuiooned about setting up teams to do/break down specific proects - could you elaborate, tigrmesh ?
2013-03-03 12:39:11            fsckd   that's a good idea, for the next meeting's agenda we'll have that info
2013-03-03 12:39:52            fsckd   as for what to do about people who join during the meeting, may be for the duration of a meeting we could set the topic to something
2013-03-03 12:40:32            fsckd   (and should mention the channel is logged during that time)
2013-03-03 12:40:35      KylieBrooks   also, make sure that the people listed will come or have a proxy for them or something that person writes up
2013-03-03 12:40:37        +tigrmesh   KylieBrooks: were you saying that the who's doing what should be in the meeting notes?
2013-03-03 12:40:50      KylieBrooks   tigrmesh: meeting page on wiki
2013-03-03 12:41:34        +tigrmesh   oh.  you mean the agenda that we've been following?  like http://redmine.archwomen.org/projects/archwomen/wiki/Meeting_Mar_2013?

2013-03-03 12:41:42      KylieBrooks   yeah 
2013-03-03 12:41:49            fsckd   hmm, topic could have the info: meeting is progress, link to agenda, link to titanpad, and that the channel is being logged
2013-03-03 12:41:57        +tigrmesh   great
2013-03-03 12:42:09      KylieBrooks   next agenda should have who is discussing what as well.
2013-03-03 12:42:34            fsckd   yes, will start making the agenda for the next meeting today
2013-03-03 12:42:38      KylieBrooks   and agree fsckd 
2013-03-03 12:42:51      KylieBrooks   and great ;)

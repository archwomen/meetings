16:23:01           phrik  Title: 28th IRC Meeting [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
16:25:57       @tigrmesh  i've copied the agenda to a riseup pad.  https://pad.riseup.net/p/arch-women-meeting_-_June_2014
16:25:58           phrik  Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
16:26:06       @tigrmesh  so we cab take meeting notes
16:26:15            hh4a  nice
16:26:34         sharvey  awesome
16:26:46           liara  i liked the class yesterday, as always:)
16:27:10  CalimeroTeknik  there was a suggestion for a class on VCS
16:27:20  CalimeroTeknik  by emlun
16:28:19            hh4a  be specific
16:28:54         sharvey  on VCSs in general? or on a specific one
16:28:57      +meskarune  gah, I forgot there was a meeting
16:29:00      +meskarune  T_T
16:29:24          demize  s/he said that it could either be Git centric or VCSs in general
16:29:40      +meskarune  I even woke up early, just didn't get online until now
16:30:00      +meskarune  I'd realy like a class on git
16:30:03         sharvey  Git centric is probably reasonable
16:30:10         sharvey  as most people use that nowadays
16:30:13              --  tigrmesh has changed topic for #archlinux-women from "Arch Linux Chix FTW: Project site is http://archwomen.org .

16:30:14          demize  I'd say that both could be useful really.
16:30:21          demize  But separate.
16:30:21         sharvey  maybe touch on a bit of history, on VCSs in general
16:30:24            hh4a  damn i missed kernel class ...
16:30:33      +meskarune  it was sweet :)
16:31:14          demize  hh4a: The logs are up if you want to read them. https://archwomen.org/media/project_classroom/classlogs/2014-05-31-first_look_at_the_linux_kernel.txt
16:32:01            hh4a  demize: thanks!
16:39:31      +meskarune  kk
16:39:33      +meskarune  meeting?
16:39:36  carharttjimmy_  am I late for the meeting?
16:39:47      +meskarune  I am too T_T
16:39:58       @tigrmesh  we were just getting started
16:40:05              --  Mode #archlinux-women [-o tigrmesh] by ChanServ
16:40:26              --  carharttjimmy_ is now known as carharttjimmy
16:40:37       +tigrmesh  i didn't set up the pad and the topic until after i'd pinged everyone
16:41:02   carharttjimmy  ah good
16:41:14   carharttjimmy  We should have a basic programming class go over an easy language
16:41:23   carharttjimmy  like Java8 or early C++
16:41:29   carharttjimmy  or even python
16:41:45   carharttjimmy  sorry, that just came in my mind and I had to get it out before it got lost
16:41:54          demize  C or some scripting language like python or ruby would probably be nice :p
16:42:14       +tigrmesh  bash?
16:42:24   carharttjimmy  that doesnt really get your feet wet
16:42:40   carharttjimmy  just sayin
16:42:44          demize  bash could also be a good scripting tutorial.
16:42:46       +tigrmesh  true
16:43:00  CalimeroTeknik  bash I can do, but I have to warn that it's a language for people who LOVE the details
16:43:03   carharttjimmy  Bash is great for a welcome to scripting
16:43:07       +tigrmesh  but it's what i could use *right now*
16:43:08      +meskarune  I think bash scripts would be sweet
16:43:12  CalimeroTeknik  otherwise it doesn't qualify as a language
16:43:16           fsckd  bash is not a good language to learn programming in. it will give you bad habits
16:43:16   carharttjimmy  ^
16:43:23   carharttjimmy  yes I am with fsckd 
16:43:31       +tigrmesh  ok
16:43:33          demize  fsckd: programming, no, but simple scripting and automation, yes.
16:43:38   carharttjimmy  we need Java, C/C++, python or something along the likes
16:43:43  CalimeroTeknik  no, it will give you good habits if you're a structured person fsckd 
16:43:51          demize  carharttjimmy: Java or C++ would be a bit... too heavy.. methinks.
16:43:52  CalimeroTeknik  otherwise it'll just be a mess, indeed
16:43:53  CalimeroTeknik  http://ctkarch.org/git/sysconfig is written in bash
16:43:56           phrik  Title: ctkarch-sysconfig (at ctkarch.org)
16:43:59   carharttjimmy  but thats a large assumption to make CalimeroTeknik 
16:44:06  CalimeroTeknik  yes
16:44:07      +meskarune  python 
16:44:12  CalimeroTeknik  that's why Rust is a good answer
16:44:13   carharttjimmy  demize, they teach both languages at intro comp sci classes
16:44:20   carharttjimmy  the languages are solid and have lots of web pages
16:44:23   carharttjimmy  along with python
16:44:25  CalimeroTeknik  because really there is no "good" language out there except ADA
16:44:27           fsckd  demize: yeah, a separate class on bash would be good, but not as an intro. to programming
16:44:31  CalimeroTeknik  and ocaml/haskell
16:44:32          demize  carharttjimmy: That's not much of a reason.
16:44:47   carharttjimmy  demize, I am not an expert on teaching programming
16:44:49  CalimeroTeknik  intro to programming : ADA is good
16:44:53            hh4a  i vote for python
16:44:54          demize  fsckd: Intro to simple automation, scripting small things you do a lot, would be nice.
16:44:57   carharttjimmy  so I am going to go with how I was taught
16:45:01            Fox^  you need to teach lisp
16:45:03           fsckd  demize: totally
16:45:10  CalimeroTeknik  python can be nice, but it has lots of weird features I'd live better without
16:45:10            Fox^  enlighten then from the beginning.
16:45:16            Fox^  With parens.
16:45:23      +meskarune  I like that python forces people to use white space, I like that java is more similar to other programming languages wiht teh parens
16:45:23   carharttjimmy  brb I need to see a carbon based unit about a horse
16:45:37   carharttjimmy  Java is great because you have API's
16:45:48   carharttjimmy  and that can make some of the "wtfs" go away
16:45:51       thiagowfx  +1 for haskell
16:45:58      +meskarune  and it can also run on everything
16:45:58            hh4a  but we are allowed to be modern arent we? Rust or Go?
16:45:59   carharttjimmy  +1 for Java8
16:46:06   carharttjimmy  brb
16:46:23          demize  No reason that we can't have all of them, there just have to be people willing to actually make a proper class.
16:46:27            Fox^  you could also teach assembly
16:46:32  CalimeroTeknik  carharttjimmy, java brings in a new level of wtfs with its over-engineered encapsulation though
16:46:55           fsckd  demize: +1
16:47:34          demize  Should make thestinger make a rust class :p
16:47:49          demize  Probably would be good to have him in if someone is going to make a C++ class too
16:48:21           fsckd  it is possible for each of you to teach an intro to programming class. i request you not do it at the same time :P
16:48:51      +meskarune  I'm surprised there aren't any ruby groupies ;)
16:49:04            Fox^  or perl
16:49:05           fsckd  no one likes ruby ಠ_ಠ
16:49:07      +meskarune  haha
16:49:22            Fox^  we could teach awk
16:49:28          demize  meskarune: Ruby is one of the first ones I suggested ;p
16:49:34          demize  Fox^: That's a good idea.
16:49:40      +meskarune  when I was playing around with just plain ole ruby, it annoyed me that there were like 20 ways to do anything, and no "best" way
16:49:53          demize  awk is a rather nice tool that few people seem to know..
16:49:55      +meskarune  but it was very simple
16:50:13      +meskarune  I only do simple things with awk/gawk scripts
16:50:20      +meskarune  but I have seen some crazy shit done with it
16:50:21            Fox^  me too
16:50:21          demize  meskarune: And in C there's 5 ways to do anything and all of them suck.
16:50:24          demize  ;p
16:50:24       thiagowfx  Also, it is cool to see something along the lines of 'here is problem X. Now, let's code it into these 10 different languages'. You know, seeing different syntaxes/styles is a way to learn programming 
16:50:25            Fox^  but it is really powerful
16:50:30      +meskarune  lol demize
16:50:38          demize  keenerd has a rather nice awk music script
16:50:44            Fox^  OH
16:50:44          demize  *real* 8-bit music :p
16:50:48            Fox^  We should teach BASIC
16:50:53      +meskarune  keenerd does crazy shit with gawk scripts
16:50:56      +meskarune  lol
16:50:56            Fox^  or maybe PASCAL
16:51:25      +meskarune  well, why don't we schedule a meeting in -classroom about a programing class?
16:51:50      +meskarune  I think that sort of class should probably use a book, maybe from wikibooks on programing?
16:52:11           fsckd  SICP ^_^
16:52:14          demize  Yeah, a programming class without a book would easily get off track otherwise
16:52:14      +meskarune  and you'd need a place for code samples, or a way to show an interactive shell
16:52:23        nisstyre  I'm late to the party I guess
16:52:27      +meskarune  howdy
16:52:57   carharttjimmy  CalimeroTeknik, but OO is all about encapuslation
16:53:06      +meskarune  So class on "intro to programming
16:53:10      +meskarune  and git?
16:53:28   carharttjimmy  or we could do a general VCS class as well?
16:53:39          demize  carharttjimmy: You don't need classes to have OO tho
16:53:43       thiagowfx  SICP is loooooong
16:53:47          demize  meskarune: Sounds good.
16:53:59         jy2wong  it strikes me that a weekly let's follow sicp meetup (or replace with any other book) might be cool
16:54:08          demize  jy2wong: Agreed
16:54:15   carharttjimmy  demize, eh, thats a rather interesting topic that I would rather go into more depth later
16:54:18           fsckd  meskarune: should i contact the person who offered to teach a class on git and guide them to make a class?
16:54:23           fsckd  jy2wong: +1
16:54:24          demize  carharttjimmy: http://joshldavis.com/2013/06/16/the-rise-of-the-gang-of-four-with-rust/ read that :p
16:54:25           phrik  Title: The Rise of the Gang of Four with Rust - Josh Davis (at joshldavis.com)
16:54:30      +meskarune  yeah, let's talk with them :)
16:54:34       +tigrmesh  thiagowfx, i love, love, lobe that idea
16:54:34   carharttjimmy  cool demize 
16:54:45      +meskarune  are they on IRC at the moment?
16:54:54   carharttjimmy  I volunteer to teach an intro to programming class on Java8
16:54:54       +tigrmesh  thiagowfx, the problem X one
16:54:55      +meskarune  it feels weird spelling atm out
16:55:10      +meskarune  ok carharttjimmy :)
16:55:26   carharttjimmy  we can have multiple classes
16:55:32           fsckd  yeah
16:55:32   carharttjimmy  if we have mutliple teachers
16:55:38        nisstyre  I can definitely teach Scheme
16:55:41   carharttjimmy  one for Java, one for scheme
16:55:46        nisstyre  I am a Scheme lover
16:55:51   carharttjimmy  we could do a whole month or so?
16:55:57          demize  nisstyre: Scheme would be interesting.
16:56:03          demize  carharttjimmy: Could do more really..
16:56:07   carharttjimmy  yeah we could
16:56:13   carharttjimmy  weekly programming classes
16:56:15           fsckd  the PKGBUILD class gtmandfred and kaictl taught was originally intended to have multiple sessions
16:56:23           fsckd  so it is perfectly fine
16:56:52      +meskarune  http://shell.appspot.com/
16:56:53           phrik  Title: Interactive Shell (at shell.appspot.com)
16:56:53   carharttjimmy  one second, connecting to vpn may interrupt my irc connection
16:57:00   carharttjimmy  I am working release right now
16:57:17      +meskarune  there are interactive shells as web apps, so that might be useful
16:57:24      +meskarune  if people don't want to use a terminal
16:58:12        nisstyre  carharttjimmy: you should use mosh
16:58:36   carharttjimmy  windows vpn
16:58:37   carharttjimmy  :/
16:58:51   carharttjimmy  I also have a bouncer service running
16:58:53       thiagowfx  tigrmesh: there is [this](http://rosettacode.org/) wiki which is inspired by this idea, but I actually never saw a dynamic thing, like a class, adopting it (it = the idea, not the wiki)
16:58:54           phrik  Title: Rosetta Code (at rosettacode.org)
16:58:55   carharttjimmy  on my remote machine
16:59:00        nisstyre  carharttjimmy: I am disappoint
16:59:10   carharttjimmy  nisstyre, I work at a .NET shop
16:59:12   carharttjimmy  lol
17:00:05       +tigrmesh  ok
17:00:30   carharttjimmy  even though I am really competent Java wise
17:01:02            hh4a  nice
17:02:25        nisstyre  it would be easy to setup some kind of Scheme REPL in a webpage
17:02:33        nisstyre  I'm sure that exists too, could find one for Racket
17:02:46        nisstyre  I would be inclined to get everyone running DrRacket eventually
17:03:42   carharttjimmy  site is offline, going for backups
17:03:45      +meskarune  thiagowfx: I've been doing soemthing simliar when learning to program, write something in python, then in php, perl and ruby too
17:03:49   carharttjimmy  I am going to have some fun today
17:03:55      +meskarune  but I don't know if that is the best way to learn
17:04:05      +meskarune  I might be going about it the long way
17:04:06   carharttjimmy  I find the best way to learn is working on small programs
17:04:24   carharttjimmy  and then reading up on advanced concepts
17:04:26      +meskarune  right now I"m working on a simple blog
17:04:34   carharttjimmy  and implementing those along the way
17:05:11      +meskarune  ok, so back on topic
17:05:23      +meskarune  we have people volunteering to teach
17:05:41      +meskarune  I think maybe we should try to get a mailing list topic on the main arch lists
17:05:42        nisstyre  I'm writing a compiler
17:05:44        nisstyre  >.>
17:05:54   carharttjimmy  top level compiler or low level?
17:05:55       +tigrmesh  ooh!
17:06:14        nisstyre  carharttjimmy: it could have multiple backends, I'm exploring generating code for a bare metal ARM processor
17:06:20        nisstyre  it's written in JavaScript btw
17:06:22        nisstyre  lol
17:06:39       +tigrmesh  compiler is compiler
17:06:46        nisstyre  https://github.com/oftn/JLambda
17:06:47   carharttjimmy  no
17:06:48           phrik  Title: oftn/JLambda · GitHub (at github.com)
17:06:51      +meskarune  cool
17:06:52   carharttjimmy  they arent the same tigrmesh 
17:07:13   carharttjimmy  sometimes you can have code -> byte code -> machine code
17:07:14        nisstyre  carharttjimmy: it is a functional compiler, meaning it does closure conversion, lambda lifting, and so on
17:07:16       +tigrmesh  carharttjimmy, i'm responding to the language the compiler is written in
17:07:25   carharttjimmy  oh i see tigrmesh 
17:07:31        nisstyre  and the intermediate language will be a continuation language
17:07:32   carharttjimmy  nice nisstyre 
17:07:52   carharttjimmy  anyways we should get back on track
17:07:54        nisstyre  having everything in terms of continuations makes it easier to generate machine code
17:07:57        nisstyre  yeah
17:08:12      +meskarune  so next thing on the list is internship, we were generating ideas for projects here: https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:internships:ideas
17:08:14           phrik  Title: Internship Project Ideas [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
17:08:20       +tigrmesh  wait!
17:08:28      +meskarune  hehe
17:08:29       +tigrmesh  are we scheduling a class?
17:08:47       +tigrmesh  this was an awesome discussion
17:09:15       +tigrmesh  anyone?
17:10:12        nisstyre  well
17:10:16   carharttjimmy  well
17:10:22        nisstyre  I don't know what the best date would be
17:10:22   carharttjimmy  we need a classroom cordinator
17:10:28        nisstyre  yeah
17:10:30       +tigrmesh  or just leave the notes as " carharttjimmy will do ??? soonish" 
17:10:34   carharttjimmy  someone who can coordinate with the teachers
17:10:43       +tigrmesh  and "well be talking to emlun" ?
17:10:45   carharttjimmy  I'll volunteer to be the classroom cordinator 
17:10:49        nisstyre  a saturday is obviously best
17:11:02        nisstyre  but I'm going to be internetless for a few days, not sure when
17:11:06       +tigrmesh  sorry.  scheduling wasn't the right word
17:11:33         sharvey  oh activity
17:11:35       +tigrmesh  more like, "classes + teachers" 
17:11:57       +tigrmesh  and thanks carharttjimmy 
17:12:35         sharvey  I know excessive amounts of Java and C fyi
17:12:49         sharvey  less excessive amounts of python
17:12:57      +meskarune  sweet
17:12:58         sharvey  if you guys need more teachers
17:13:05        nisstyre  I've programmed Python "professionally"
17:13:11        nisstyre  and for 7 years or so
17:13:16       +tigrmesh  so carharttjimmy - you'll be classroom coordinator?  did you also mention a specific class?
17:13:19      +meskarune  basically anyone who wants to teach a class will have our support/infrastructure
17:13:37         sharvey  my python experience comes from research coding, so nisstyre you probably are more qualified in that arena than I :P
17:13:48      +meskarune  help with teaching materials and hosting for files, etc
17:13:50   carharttjimmy  I'll be teaching "Intro to Java8"
17:13:56    almost_fsckd  ill coordinate too
17:13:59   carharttjimmy  yes I will be tigrmesh 
17:14:19   carharttjimmy  I will work with almost_fsckd as my partner in crime
17:14:50    almost_fsckd  XD
17:14:58         sharvey  oh, also

17:15:10         sharvey  if like, any of you are in college
17:15:15         sharvey  deadline is pretty soon though to apply
17:16:00       +tigrmesh  i think someone from this channel will be applying   :)
17:16:08       +tigrmesh  at least one person  \o/
17:16:08         sharvey  hooray
17:16:17         sharvey  if any of you get in, let me know
17:16:27       +tigrmesh  oh?
17:16:30         sharvey  I'm interning there right now, so it would be cool to meet people from this channel
17:16:43       +tigrmesh  a w e s o m e
17:16:55   carharttjimmy  I am an intern for a SAAS company
17:17:05   carharttjimmy  so we have more interns here. Yay!
17:17:10         sharvey  hooray!
17:17:16    almost_fsckd  nice sharvey
17:17:40   carharttjimmy  Do we have an Archlinux-Women-classroom github repo?
17:17:52    almost_fsckd  yes
17:18:27   carharttjimmy  k
17:18:29    almost_fsckd  look for classroom-media
17:18:39   carharttjimmy  okay I see it now
17:19:03    almost_fsckd  ill give perms when im back
17:19:05        nisstyre  sweet I got synergy working :D
17:19:13       +tigrmesh  nisstyre and sharvey would you two be willing to get together and talk about a python class?  maybe you can do it together, or 2 levels
17:19:14        nisstyre  now I can control my desktop and laptop at the same time
17:19:26        nisstyre  tigrmesh: perhaps yeah
17:19:27       +tigrmesh  :)
17:19:33        nisstyre  I'd still like to teach some Scheme
17:19:44        nisstyre  maybe that can be an "advanced" class after
17:19:52       +tigrmesh  yeah
17:19:59         sharvey  I'm cool with whatever, but my python experience is limited to data crunching stuff
17:20:06         sharvey  I have only worked with it for about a year
17:20:42        nisstyre  I've been using it long enough to know most of the common mistakes
17:20:57        nisstyre  and to spot problems easily
17:24:36   carharttjimmy  I know a lot of enterprise languages
17:25:18      +meskarune  I know enough to know bad code when I see it
17:25:19    almost_fsckd  starship enterprise? 
17:25:21      +meskarune  thats about it
17:25:36         sharvey  enterpriiiise
17:25:50         sharvey  I write java currently
17:26:32           Aster  ..What?
17:26:37           Aster  A meeting I haven't quite missed?
17:26:42           Aster  Great
17:26:52         sharvey  hi there!
17:27:10   carharttjimmy  I work in VB.NET, C# and I do fun programs in Java
17:27:54        nisstyre  right now I have a summer research job doing Haskell
17:28:00       +tigrmesh  hi Aster !
17:28:03      +meskarune  hi aster
17:28:05           Aster  Hey there
17:28:18      +meskarune  you missed fsckd's star pun ;)
17:28:33      +meskarune  we are talking about more classes
17:28:35           Aster  D:
17:28:44      +meskarune  so a class on intro to programming and git/vcs
17:28:47           Aster  I have my scrollback for this channel set to 50 lines or something
17:30:48      +meskarune  I need an irc log reader web app
17:31:03  CalimeroTeknik  carharttjimmy, I would like you to not go into the argument we've always had and I always have with java developers; the thing is, when you need something *real* done, encapsulation is in the way and your only option is to read the code (encapsulated)
17:31:35  CalimeroTeknik  for instance, logging. you want the method that writes a log message to guarantee that it will be written on disk when the function returns
17:31:50   carharttjimmy  not now CalimeroTeknik 
17:31:51  CalimeroTeknik  in java, you don't really know and just assume that calling flush will work
17:32:02  CalimeroTeknik  in C you call fsync() on the file.
17:32:05      +meskarune  yeah, can you take to pm? :)
17:32:21  CalimeroTeknik  oh, sorry! it's the meeting, right?
17:32:26      +meskarune  hehe yep :P
17:32:28           Aster  Language arguments are futile. Let's all use x86 Assembly instead.
17:32:28      +meskarune  <3
17:33:06      +meskarune  ok, any other suggestions or volunteers for classroom stuff? :)
17:33:23      +meskarune  I'd honestly like to get some funding
17:33:44      +meskarune  so we could maybe pay teachers a small stipend or something
17:33:53      +meskarune  it would be nice for classes that are more longer term
17:34:20  CalimeroTeknik  longer term?
17:34:21      +meskarune  I don't know anything about fund raising for projects
17:34:21       +tigrmesh  yeah
17:34:33  CalimeroTeknik  you mean several classes then?
17:34:35      +meskarune  but we'd like to do quiet a few things that require funds
17:34:45   carharttjimmy  what if we launch a seperate project group for it?
17:35:53       +tigrmesh  meskarune, i have some ideas about that.  can we talk after the meeting about this?
17:36:01      +meskarune  sure :)
17:36:22       +tigrmesh  and then bring it to next month's meeting  :)
17:37:17      +meskarune  sounds good to me :)
17:38:26       +tigrmesh  ready to move the next item.  you said what it.  but i derailed you.  and we kind of jumped in in the middle...
17:38:35       +tigrmesh  so what's mext, meskarune ?
17:42:01       +tigrmesh  uh-oh
17:42:16          demize  meskarune ran away?
17:42:46       +tigrmesh  also possible connection problem
17:42:54   carharttjimmy  demize, I told you to throw the pokeball earlier
17:43:12       +tigrmesh  <meskarune> so next thing on the list is internship, we were generating ideas for projects here: https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:internships:ideas
17:43:13           phrik  Title: Internship Project Ideas [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
17:43:34          demize  Hmm, she seems to be responding to pings :p
17:43:37      +meskarune  bah
17:43:41      +meskarune  internets lol
17:43:44          demize  She returns!
17:43:46      +meskarune  :)
17:44:08      +meskarune  kk, so internship ideas
17:44:31      +meskarune  basically we were looking at OPW (outreach program for women)
17:44:44      +meskarune  and to apply you need some project ideas and some mentors
17:45:18       +tigrmesh  is that gnome?
17:49:12      +meskarune  yeah
17:49:29      +meskarune  they don't have a college student requirement, so anyone can apply for the internshilps
17:49:42      +meskarune  we can aply to GSOC also
17:49:48      +meskarune  you can be an organization in both
17:50:02      +meskarune  but to do that, we need project ideas and mentors for the projects
17:51:50       +tigrmesh  there was something on the forums about a possible arch GSoC intern.  i don't remember if there was much interest
17:53:33       +tigrmesh  https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=176184
17:53:34           phrik  Title: Google Summer of Code 2014 (Page 1) / Arch Discussion / Arch Linux Forums (at bbs.archlinux.org)
17:57:25      +meskarune  yeah, looks like the thread died
17:57:29      +meskarune  "Also if Arch does want to participate as a GSOC project, we gotta set up an ideas page with a mentor list"
17:57:39      +meskarune  so basically that is what we need, mentors and projects that need doing
17:58:12      +meskarune  maybe I'll revive the thread?
17:59:58   carharttjimmy  we could have an intern and I and a few others work on an android app for arch women?
18:01:17   carharttjimmy  just an idea
18:03:49   carharttjimmy  or we could work on software that Arch Women is sponsorig
18:05:25      +meskarune  yeah, we basically just need some ideas 
18:05:27      +meskarune  :)
18:05:42      +meskarune  https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:internships:ideas
18:05:43           phrik  Title: Internship Project Ideas [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
18:05:50      +meskarune  so any ideas people have can go on the list :)
18:06:21       +tigrmesh  maybe it would be good to have a smaller project group to talk about this stuff
18:06:28   carharttjimmy  agreed
18:06:31   carharttjimmy  a work group
18:06:38       +tigrmesh  and break it down into smaller pieces
18:06:40   carharttjimmy  IETF has work groups for stuff
18:06:46   carharttjimmy  we can follow the same
18:07:13   carharttjimmy  we will need two-three work group leads
18:07:13      +meskarune  wasn't there a project for hosting your own private repo to update multiple machines on the same LAN?
18:07:27      +meskarune  I think it needs some work/revival
18:07:39   carharttjimmy  I am willing to sponsor multiple log aggrevation
18:07:54   carharttjimmy  then people who have logs everywhere
18:08:01   carharttjimmy  can use one program
18:08:08   carharttjimmy  including db logs
18:08:16         sharvey  aggregation?
18:08:19         sharvey  or aggrevation
18:08:36       +tigrmesh  wait, wiat
18:08:36            hh4a  just something to aggree on ?
18:08:53   carharttjimmy  aggregration
18:08:56         sharvey  aggregation is putting it all in one place
18:08:58       +tigrmesh  how about like just a time for people interested to talk?
18:09:06   carharttjimmy  yes sharvey exacly
18:09:07         sharvey  aggrevation is making people upset
18:09:14   carharttjimmy  the first one
18:09:32   carharttjimmy  write a parser so it can be intelligent
18:09:36            hh4a  we should upset more people
18:10:02   carharttjimmy  I volunteer to be a Intern Workgroup Lead
18:10:08   carharttjimmy  unless someone else is interested
18:10:15   carharttjimmy  then its all yours
18:10:29        nisstyre  I'm not interested, you can probably win by default
18:11:05      +meskarune  hehe
18:11:08            hh4a  carharttjimmy: loves wining by default
18:11:30            hh4a  thats a good idea thou
18:11:37       +tigrmesh  i'm interested in being part of the group
18:11:52   carharttjimmy  well I want stuff to get done
18:12:04   carharttjimmy  so sometimes you have to saddle up and get on the rhino
18:12:09            hh4a  i can be a footnote if ya want
18:12:10       +tigrmesh  so let's set a time to talk further
18:12:30       +tigrmesh  what are you doing next sunday, carharttjimmy ?
18:12:44   carharttjimmy  talking about interns
18:12:54       +tigrmesh  what time?
18:12:58   carharttjimmy  I will let you know when sunday gets closer
18:13:03       +tigrmesh  ok
18:13:15   carharttjimmy  I am free after 1 though
18:14:55      +meskarune  ok, anything else with internship stuff?
18:15:02      +meskarune  do we need a wiki page or soemthing?
18:15:11   carharttjimmy  wiki page 
18:15:30   carharttjimmy  and a subscription to NHL all season pass for next year
18:15:55   carharttjimmy  so the interns can watch Hockey with me
18:15:57   carharttjimmy  err
18:15:59   carharttjimmy  with us
18:16:05   carharttjimmy  :P
18:18:23      +meskarune  :P
18:18:29          demize  For.. science?
18:18:36            hh4a  finale?
18:18:52  terra-and-luna   *reading through the backlog* tigrmesh, fsckd, carharttjimmy, the only problem with a Java8 class is that there isn't a clean way of installing it on arch. you either have to head to the AUR for oracle's version or add an external repo (as mentioned on the mailing list) because openjdk8 isn't in the repos
18:19:14   carharttjimmy  its coming
18:19:18   carharttjimmy  but I agree
18:19:22   carharttjimmy  Java7 it is
18:19:40   carharttjimmy  until openjdk8 hits stable (they are waiting on IcedTea8)
18:19:47              --  Mode #archlinux-women [+v tigr] by ChanServ
18:19:59   carharttjimmy  (Java 8 snapshots build for Arch perfectly though)
18:20:08           Aster  We're doing a Java 8 class?
18:20:16           +tigr  yes
18:20:18   carharttjimmy  (As well as Java9)
18:20:24          demize  Yeah, the dev has a separate repo with openjdk8 without icedtea until they release icedtea for 8
18:20:27           Aster  No comment.
18:20:58   carharttjimmy  Arguing over languages is pointless and only divides us more
18:21:19           Aster  I agree with that.
18:21:37   carharttjimmy  We will be having multiple language classrooms
18:21:38           +tigr  have i pinged out yet?
18:21:43           Aster  tigr: yup
18:21:45               *  tigr shoots her machine
18:21:47  terra-and-luna  but yeah. i offer my services as an assistant for a java, python, or c class.
18:21:47   carharttjimmy  so choice is better
18:21:57           +tigr  terra-and-luna, yay
18:22:04              --  tigr is now known as tigrmesh
18:22:12   carharttjimmy  terra-and-luna, you know, you are always welcomed to help me with Java
18:22:31   carharttjimmy  I was actually going to ask you later :)
18:22:42           Aster  I agree to teaching newer languages like Scala or Dart. Or more "eternal" languages like Assembly, C and C++. Or modern and elegant languages like C#.
18:23:01      +meskarune  sweet :)
18:23:03   carharttjimmy  another time Aster 
18:23:03           Aster  I don't agree to teaching old languages that were just added upon to keep up with its competitors.
18:23:15           Aster  Not another time. This is relevant.
18:23:28   carharttjimmy  there is a lot about Java8 that makes it more powerful than C#
18:23:35           Aster  Why teach something like Java, when you could teach languages that have a lot more demand?
18:23:39      +meskarune  Do you mean teaching a class or other people teaching a class Aster ?
18:23:49           Aster  meskarune: "having a class" in general.
18:24:03   carharttjimmy  Java is still used heavily in industry....
18:24:09           Aster  Less and less.
18:24:09   carharttjimmy  and with Google losing to Oracle
18:24:12   carharttjimmy  its here to stay 
18:24:15           Aster  It's also a huge language.
18:24:17      +meskarune  idk, I feel that if someone wants to teach a class, and people want to go to that class to learn, its fine
18:24:25      +meskarune  doesn't affect the people who aren't interested
18:24:27      +meskarune  :P
18:24:35           Aster  Eh
18:24:41       +tigrmesh  Aster,  2 reasons:  1) we wanted an intro class, and 2) someone volunteered
18:24:44   carharttjimmy  c# is only powerful if you are using .NET
18:24:53         sharvey  Java has demand still
18:25:02           Aster  Much less than it did a few years ago.
18:25:02   carharttjimmy  and yes Java has a lot of demand
18:25:18         sharvey  it's kind of arguable I think
18:25:22   carharttjimmy  indeed
18:25:27      +meskarune  people still use cold fusion and perl and php too ;)
18:25:42         sharvey  PHP is technically used heavily if you consider facebook
18:25:47   carharttjimmy  when IBM and Redhat leave openjdk development I will move on
18:25:49         sharvey  but then again it's their variant of PHP
18:25:55      +meskarune  I don't have an opinion on java, i've never used it before 
18:26:05   carharttjimmy  and anyways openjdk8+ will be the basis for Java8+
18:26:08         sharvey  square uses RoR+Java extensively
18:26:21   carharttjimmy  c# is not like that
18:26:27   carharttjimmy  and c# is a framework language
18:26:41   carharttjimmy  totally different than Java where Java is API based
18:26:51           Aster  This isn't a language argument. This is a "Think about the Future" argument.
18:26:57         sharvey  shrug
18:27:03   carharttjimmy  we dont know what language will be in the future
18:27:07         sharvey  everyone needs to be adaptable anyway in this industry
18:27:13           Aster  I don't care which language is better or not. imo x86-32 assembly is the best language.
18:27:14      +meskarune  kk, so far we've talked about teaching some classes, and a few people have volunteered, and talked about project ideas for an internship
18:27:21      +meskarune  with OPW and GSOC
18:27:36         sharvey  you don't just learn one language and stick with it, but learn a number of language paradigms and be adaptable
18:27:54   carharttjimmy  Learning a language helps you understand how the language workj
18:28:07         sharvey  learning multiple languages is ideal
18:28:07   carharttjimmy  learning core programming concepts teach you how to program
18:28:19   carharttjimmy  the language gets in the way a bit
18:28:38   carharttjimmy  but at the root level they all act the same when they are running on a VM or CLR
18:28:40   carharttjimmy  or w/e
18:28:48   carharttjimmy  c/c++ is different
18:29:17         sharvey  meskarune: completely side tangent; is there interest in getting a meetup at grace hopper?
18:29:24       +tigrmesh  Aster, i get what you're saying.  but we can only offer classes we can teach.  if you know someone in the larger community who would be willing to come and teach a short intro class on irc, we'd love that
18:30:07      +meskarune  sharvey: I'd love to go to a conference, but atm I don't have the money 
18:30:09   carharttjimmy  arguably speaking, once you get locked into a language you will always need those devs
18:30:20      +meskarune  but it would be awesome to have a conference meet up
18:30:21       +tigrmesh  Aster, maybe this will make the java class more palatable:  at least it's not a COBOL class.  ;)   i have a decade of COBOL experience, and could totally teach one
18:30:24            hh4a  oh i volunteer for awk, mentioned it on the Pad lol
18:30:33       +tigrmesh  ok
18:30:36      +meskarune  thanks hh4a
18:30:47         sharvey  meskarune: for those who are in college, they should bug their department on sending them
18:31:08         sharvey  for those who are at companies, bug your boss I guess?
18:31:19   carharttjimmy  but its not .NET related
18:31:20   carharttjimmy  :/
18:31:23           Aster  tigrmesh: eh. I didn't even want to start a language battle
18:31:46            hh4a  iam jerbless i have to bug myself
18:31:46         sharvey  tigrmesh: funnily enough I might be interested in learning a bit of COBOL :P
18:32:03       +tigrmesh  sharvey, talk to me after the meeting
18:32:17       +tigrmesh  Aster, it's a really good point though
18:32:18         sharvey  ok
18:33:01   carharttjimmy  but in the end, language is hard to gauge where it will be in the market
18:33:01            hh4a  well have to go, l8r i guess
18:33:20   carharttjimmy  so many factors you have to add in
18:33:29   carharttjimmy  vendor lockin is the biggest
18:33:46   carharttjimmy  and have you tried converting legacy applications written in one language to another?
18:34:00   carharttjimmy  thats a lot of money to spend 
18:34:20   carharttjimmy  when you could be having those developers work on other features
18:34:28           Aster  tigrmesh: I could argue about it all day, but it's useless the second an enthusiast pipes up.
18:34:30       +tigrmesh  =================HEY==================
18:34:45       +tigrmesh  time to move on.  
18:34:55   carharttjimmy  anyways, whats next on the agenda?
18:35:26       +tigrmesh  any server updates, meskarune ?
18:36:30       +tigrmesh  i'd like to cover this stuff before we get to the next big item
18:36:45       +tigrmesh  anyone noticed any problems with the site?
18:36:50       +tigrmesh  slowness or anything?
18:38:44        khyperia  is the meeting still going on?
18:38:49       +tigrmesh  yes
18:39:07        khyperia  ah, cool, I was off graduating
18:39:19       +tigrmesh  congratulation khyperia !

18:41:15         sharvey  haha
18:43:18   carharttjimmy  awesome
18:44:24   carharttjimmy  and the fun of releasing software starts, I will be in and out for now
18:44:35   carharttjimmy  we're upgrading our SAAS
18:44:45   carharttjimmy  well pushing new code to it
18:45:06       +tigrmesh  also, thanks to jy2wong for leading the kernel class.  everyone has said they liked it   :)
18:46:20       +tigrmesh  so
18:46:21    almost_fsckd  many thanks to jy2wong. it was a great class 
18:46:47      +meskarune  yeah, really informative

18:48:22   carharttjimmy  and more fun now
18:48:32   carharttjimmy  stuff doesnt work :/
18:48:37       +tigrmesh  dang
18:48:51         jy2wong  awww :)
18:48:53   carharttjimmy  anyways, yes jy2wong I heard did an awesome job
18:49:16         jy2wong  sharvey: if I apply and get in, do I get to meet you again? :P
18:49:31         sharvey  :P
18:49:33         sharvey  sure
18:49:35         sharvey  also
18:49:39         sharvey  do you want an internship/job?
18:50:42         jy2wong  not at the moment. it also appears the meeting is still going on
18:52:13       +tigrmesh  yes
18:52:22       +tigrmesh  so
18:52:26    almost_fsckd  for those who don't know the channel is logged during meetings 
18:52:44       +tigrmesh  so you can read anything you missed  :)
18:52:58       +tigrmesh  also, i forgot to put it in the channel topic.  sorry
18:53:17       +tigrmesh  so i've wanted to rewrite the rules for this channel for a long time
18:53:35       +tigrmesh  this is my draft document
18:54:47       +tigrmesh  everything above and below the "============" lines are not part of it.  also, what's in the brackets after NOTE:
18:54:48       +tigrmesh  https://pad.riseup.net/p/v2_arch-women-rules-playpen-jun2014
18:54:49           phrik  Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
18:57:21       +tigrmesh  anyone have any suggestions or comments?
18:58:23       +tigrmesh  i also have some silly additional lines that i will share after the meeting is over and the logging ends
18:59:23      +meskarune  how to do people feel about the channel culture too?
18:59:29      +meskarune  are there things you'd like to see changed?
19:01:12          tugrik  tigrmesh: I think the "be mindful" sentence is particularly well put
19:01:46      +meskarune  oh and if folks want to pm me, thats fine
19:01:47       +tigrmesh  thank you  :)
19:01:49         jy2wong  agreed
19:02:03          tugrik  if we're going for "full on" QA, the line containing "creeped out" needs a space removing after the asterisk so it lines up with everything else
19:02:54       +tigrmesh  and we are!
19:02:57       +tigrmesh  and done!
19:02:59          tugrik  that line is also especially well put, considering that it's a difficult subject to raise and, IMHO, you've got to finish it with "it's our call, we're not going to argue definitions"
19:03:47   carharttjimmy  agreed
19:03:53       +tigrmesh  you think that sentence is not clear enough?
19:04:15          tugrik  I'd change "probably not negotiable" to "not negotiable" in the "Asking you" line
19:04:59      +meskarune  heh, yeah people might take that as a free pass to harass OP's
19:05:01          tugrik  ah, sorry, the bit I just typed in quotes ( "it's ...  definitions" ) was just me summarising that point of view - you've already expressed it well enough
19:05:20       +tigrmesh  "not negotiable" is in 2 places
19:05:41       +tigrmesh  creeps exit.  not negotiable
19:07:06      +meskarune  I think its short and covers most things that people might be punished for
19:07:08          tugrik  overall afaict it's fine, it's quick enough for people to read; simple enough that it'll put anyone off who's casually looking for an online argument
19:07:12          tugrik  yes, what meskarune said
19:08:09       +tigrmesh  some things are more about personal style.  if someone complains about being single everywhere, they'd complain about it here.  so that might be solvable with a simple request
19:10:11       +tigrmesh  i was really going after the 'not quantifiable' in the "creeped out" line
19:11:17       +tigrmesh  would it be better to remove the 'not negotiable' from that line and just tighten up the 'Asking' line?
19:11:52          tugrik  yeah, good point, I'd finish that sentence with "op doing so."
19:12:58       +tigrmesh  please paste the whole sentence.  
19:13:20       +tigrmesh  also, it's an etherpad.  you can make the change
19:13:30          tugrik  "Asking you to leave/muting/banning are entirely at the discretion of the channel op doing so.  Evading a ban or quiet will result in a permanent ban."
19:14:10       +tigrmesh  what would you like it to be?
19:14:38          tugrik  that sentence I just typed, I think that's the clearest and simplest it can be
19:16:06       +tigrmesh  had you already changed it?
19:16:23          tugrik  not me, I regard editing documents in web browsers as heresy ;)
19:16:27       +tigrmesh  i'm seeing the same thing
19:16:28       +tigrmesh  haha
19:16:41       +tigrmesh  Asking you to leave/muting/banning are entirely at the discretion of the channel op doing so.  Evading a ban or quiet will result in a permanent ban.
19:16:57       +tigrmesh  is what i see
19:17:31          tugrik  that's fine, although for clarity to non-native speakers... should op be "Op"?  Also "quiet" as a noun isn't something I'm familiar with....
19:18:09          tugrik  but I QA "professionally" quite often, so I might be over-doing it
19:18:27      +meskarune  in IRC its +q I think
19:18:29          tugrik  yes, better
19:18:48      +meskarune  a person is muted in channel but they can still see what others say?
19:18:56       +tigrmesh  yes
19:19:08       +tigrmesh  they can come and go, just can't speak
19:20:03       +tigrmesh  iirc, someone banned but not kicked out can still see what others say.  but once they're out they can't return
19:20:35          tugrik  nicely put, I'd regard that document as "ready for release"
19:21:11       +tigrmesh  one moment
19:23:02       +tigrmesh  one final thing.  i've been wondering about explicitly using the word "harassment".  it think it's kind of intimidating and invites intellectual discussion and research of the "rules"
19:23:31       +tigrmesh  but "making me feel bad", while sounding wimpy, is much more clear
19:24:09          tugrik  I don't think it sounds wimpy, it's "this is our house, if you come into our house and make us unhappy, we'll ask you to leave the house"
19:24:27       +tigrmesh  "does it meet the definition of harassment?  dunno.  did it make someone feel bad about being female?  yes."  out the person goes
19:24:36       +tigrmesh  ok
19:27:32          tugrik  I *think* if you start defining behaviours then people will argue about behaviours and how to define them; if you express the rules in terms of their impact on the channel's participants, you don't give miscreants a basis to argue on - they can say "this isn't harrassment", they can't say "you're not unhappy"
19:28:42       +tigrmesh  ok
19:29:14          tugrik  it's an interesting situation, especially for document designed to mean different things to different audiences, so I hope I'm contributing rather than mansplaining ;)
19:30:08       +tigrmesh  your feedback has been very helpful.  to me
19:30:35       +tigrmesh  anyone else have comments about it?
19:30:53         jy2wong  I'm in agreement with what tugrik's saying
19:30:56      +meskarune  I really like it
19:31:24      +meskarune  its clear that if people are coming in for the wrong reasons they won't stay long
19:31:28       +tigrmesh  and if you don't feel comfortable saying anything here PM meskarune or me
19:32:16       +tigrmesh  anything else before we close?
19:33:08      +meskarune  The meeting has covered classes, internship and irc rules
19:33:24      +meskarune  any additional comments, suggestions, things to talk about next meeting, etc?
19:35:16      +meskarune  I guess I'll close the meeting :)
19:35:25      +meskarune  ================== Meeting Ends ======================

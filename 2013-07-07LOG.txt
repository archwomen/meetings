12:23:54   +meskarune   *** Meeting Started ***
12:24:42   +meskarune   First thing on the agenda, main site, blog, etc
12:25:53   +meskarune   so I worked on a grid template system that should allow us to create content across various sites and platforms that match
12:26:19   +meskarune   I'm probably just anal, but it bothers me when I go to another section of a site, and the header matches but the position is a few pixels off
12:27:02   +meskarune   we can use the same css file for redmine and any other CMS that we use
12:27:11   +meskarune   so it will make it easy to integrate everything
12:27:17        fsckd   awesome
12:27:48   +meskarune   I'll make up a "toolkit" with examples so anyone can contribute easily
12:29:06   +meskarune   the blog is up but still needs a bit of work. I don't think the archive pages are working :?
12:29:33   +meskarune   if anyone is interested in web developement or want to learn, let me know ;)
12:29:46   +meskarune   it will only hurt a little ;D
12:30:19   +meskarune   there is also a simple post submission page 
12:30:27   +meskarune   http://archwomen.org/test/submit
12:30:59        phrik   Title: Submit Post (at archwomen.org)
12:31:00   +meskarune   There are some features I'd like to see, like html preview, but its lowish priority
12:31:05     MarkDude   Great idea with post page also :) +1
12:31:25   +meskarune   the blog is static, but not everyone understands how git works
12:31:39   +meskarune   so this way anyone can submit a markdown post, and it goes into a folder for review
12:32:53   +meskarune   we'll need to make the drafts folder a git repository, and then have posts automatically added to the repository when they are added
12:33:29   +meskarune   we also need to convert our posts on github into the new format, and the submission form makes that easier
12:34:28   +meskarune   so we are making progress on the page, but need people to help write, and edit content
12:34:34   +meskarune   (most edit my content)
12:34:50      yardena   is the meeting at 10?
12:35:11        fsckd   yardena: it's in progress right now :)
12:35:14   +meskarune   12 EST :)
12:35:21   +meskarune   but it was started a little late
12:35:26      yardena   ooh i didn't see the line
12:35:28   +meskarune   yardena: we are doing status updates :)
12:35:49        fsckd   you're not too late, started about 10-15 min. ago
12:36:03   +meskarune   yardena: check out https://archwomen.org
12:36:05   +meskarune   new site
12:36:14        phrik   Title: Arch Linux Women (at archwomen.org)
12:36:16   +meskarune   but we need to make all the pages, like join, about, etc
12:36:28      yardena   \o/
12:36:37   +meskarune   I want to get enough up so we can start emailing organizations about sponsorship
12:36:49   +meskarune   and get some resources to do more
12:37:00      yardena   an all inclusize organization
12:37:03   +meskarune   most groups want a site and flyers, etc
12:37:26   +meskarune   yeah, I'm gonna need help with wording and editing, etc
12:37:28   +meskarune   :)
12:37:48   +meskarune   seriously, if anyone wants to write a little bit or edit, or you notice a spelling mistake, let us know
12:38:09        fsckd   or make a pull request :)
12:38:16   +meskarune   hehe ++
12:38:49   +meskarune   yardena: also still drinking my coffee >.>
12:38:51   +meskarune   lol
12:39:06   +meskarune   does anyone have questions about the new site stuff?
12:40:07           *    MarkDude assumes he falls under the Ally part :)
12:41:01        fsckd   i think we should talk about that in today's meeting. how do allies fit in a-w
12:41:19        fsckd   if it's ok with y'all i'll append it to the agenda
12:44:23     MarkDude   +1
12:44:34           *    MarkDude is reading up on redmine :)
12:45:04        fsckd   added
12:45:25     MarkDude   Part of being an ally means I should *listen* to how I can help ;D
12:45:36      yardena   sadly i have to go in 5 minutes
12:45:45        fsckd   :(
12:46:24   +meskarune   yardena: its ok, we have notes :). is there anything you want to add?
12:46:52      yardena   i think i'm good, thanks
12:47:04      yardena   i'll send some pull requests later
12:47:13   +meskarune   :)
12:47:18      yardena   if nobody beats me to it
12:47:21   +meskarune   haha
12:47:37   +meskarune   so next thing on the agenda is the irc bot :)
12:47:57        fsckd   right
12:48:17        fsckd   the bot is actually working :)
12:48:42        fsckd   there are going to be two stages for deploying
12:49:00        fsckd   first stage, get it to replace the existing awbot and awbot-logr
12:49:16        fsckd   those two do announcements and logging, respectively
12:49:39   +meskarune   cool
12:49:43        fsckd   the second stage will be to replace phrik
12:50:44        fsckd   for the first stage, we need two things, a control program to manipulate the bot form the command line and persistence
12:51:04        fsckd   i'm working on the control part. carharttjimmy is working on persistence
12:51:32        fsckd   once those tow things are done, the bot can be rapidly developed to replace the existing awbots
12:52:48        fsckd   from* two*
12:53:01   +meskarune   sounds awesome
12:53:21   +meskarune   and I'd like to learn more programming, so maybe I can practice with some plugins
12:53:49        fsckd   sure. i'll need to make documentation for everything
12:53:59   +meskarune   I can help with that :D
12:54:08        fsckd   haha excellent XD
12:54:17   +meskarune   I can mostly figure out what things do by looking at the code
12:54:28   +meskarune   just not a very strong programmer yet
12:55:49   +meskarune   that also sounds like a great oppertunity for an intership
12:55:54   +meskarune   web dev and programming
12:56:13        fsckd   hmm, may be it is
12:56:41   +meskarune   haha ;)
12:56:56   +meskarune   is that all of the status updates and announcements?
12:57:02        fsckd   i think so
12:57:12   +meskarune   so onto the agenda
12:57:24   +meskarune   Arch Classroom
12:58:15        fsckd   kaictl: manfred: any plans or ideas when classroom can resume?
12:59:26      manfred   wow... perfect timing
12:59:30      manfred   i just work up :)
12:59:33      manfred   fsckd: we were just talking about it the other week
12:59:39        fsckd   cool
12:59:54   +meskarune   good morning manfred :)
13:00:04      manfred   my brother comes in the 24th, and will be here until the next monday, so i was thinking the first weekend in august, if kaictl is good with that
13:01:17   +meskarune   and there are no holidays then ;)
13:01:30   +meskarune   + summer vacation
13:02:18      manfred   right
13:03:51   +meskarune   do you need any sort of hosting or other resources?
13:04:44      manfred   we already have the instructions on the archwomen.org iirc
13:05:05        fsckd   yes, you and kaictl have push access
13:05:20      manfred   right
13:06:24      manfred   aight, i think that covers everything you need from me?
13:07:38        fsckd   if the first week of August, can you guys be sure by the end of this week?
13:07:44      manfred   yes
13:07:51        fsckd   ok great
13:07:53      manfred   i just need to talk to him again
13:08:08        fsckd   awesome :)
13:08:44   +meskarune   yay
13:09:23   +meskarune   so next up is a new issue tracker and wiki
13:09:27   +meskarune   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue-tracking_systems
13:09:29        phrik   Title: Comparison of issue-tracking systems - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
13:09:47   +meskarune   we are using redmine right now
13:10:13   +meskarune   redmine is nice, but it is ruby on rails based, uses lots of system resources, and its a bit of a PITA to keep updated
13:10:33   +meskarune   and it HAS to be kept up-to-date for security
13:11:03      manfred   i am a bit partial to RT, nice email based tracker
13:11:12      manfred   but i need to go through the aur and fix it
13:11:40      manfred   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_Tracker
13:11:41        phrik   Title: Request Tracker - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (at en.wikipedia.org)
13:13:25      manfred   i have to go get a haircut :P http://i.imgur.com/KUEHEus.jpg, bbl
13:14:00   +meskarune   oh cool, perl based, with a web area and you can update tickets through email
13:14:09   +meskarune   thanks for the recomendation manfred 
13:15:56        fsckd   that looks nice
13:16:32        fsckd   a-w has both social and software projects
13:17:22        fsckd   some trackers are intended for software dev going as far as facilitating certain workflows which would not work for a-w
13:19:20   +meskarune   it has an API as well
13:19:27        fsckd   yeah
13:19:37        fsckd   i like that it works over email
13:19:44   +meskarune   yeah, me too
13:19:49   +meskarune   we can do more research
13:19:55        fsckd   yeah
13:19:58   +meskarune   any other suggestions?
13:20:03        fsckd   oh, it has a command line tool
13:20:14   +meskarune   waaaaaaaaaht
13:20:41        fsckd   wikipedia says, "A basic REST-like API and a command-line tool are also provided as another way to interact with RT."
13:20:44   +meskarune   I also kinda like perl
13:20:47           *    meskarune hides
13:21:20        fsckd   lol
13:22:07        fsckd   what i've been thinking is
13:22:53        fsckd   if we have a separate wiki and tracker, the wiki can be in the forefront. that is, people iwll be linked to the wiki to learn baout the project
13:23:06        fsckd   and the wiki will have a link to the tracker
13:23:28        fsckd   for each project
13:23:34        fsckd   that is, no link to the tracker from the front page
13:24:01        fsckd   oh, suggestion for wiki, i was thinking something like moinmoin or gitit
13:25:18   +meskarune   and those are both git based?
13:25:43   +meskarune   the wiki will have information for administrators and members a like
13:25:55   +meskarune   and its community based documentation
13:26:04        fsckd   oh damn, i posted in the wrong channel
13:26:07        fsckd   lol
13:26:17   +meskarune   and we can link back to the arch wiki too
13:26:19   +meskarune   lol fsckd 
13:26:28        fsckd   no nevermind i posted in the right channel
13:26:47        fsckd   nevermind me, i am a little confused at the moment
13:27:02     MarkDude   +1 extra coffee or tea
13:27:02        fsckd   where am i? who are you? save me!
13:27:32           *    MarkDude wonders why Im typing on irc XD Am I in the Matrix?
13:27:45     MarkDude   sp/in/ part of
13:27:47   +meskarune   we are all in the matrix
13:28:04     MarkDude   Cool, just wanted confirmation ;)
13:29:20        fsckd   meskarune: moinmoin is not git based, gitit is
13:29:34        fsckd   moinmoin is used by ubuntu women iirc
13:30:45     MarkDude   Yep the main Ubuntu wiki is Moin
13:36:09   +meskarune   cool
13:38:02   +meskarune   moinmoin has RSS feeds and revision history, nice
13:38:20   +meskarune   multilanguage support
13:38:40   +meskarune   what is it based off of?
13:39:13        fsckd   python
13:39:16   +meskarune   nice
13:39:38   +meskarune   so we can stick it in a virtual enviroment, then use gunicorn with lighttpd
13:39:54   +meskarune   does anyone know about its resource usage?
13:40:12        fsckd   i do not
13:40:20        fsckd   i'd like to know that
13:40:30   +meskarune   maybe I can make a test install on another server :)
13:40:42        fsckd   sure :)
13:41:29   +meskarune   the other option gitit is git based but also have web admin
13:42:08   +meskarune   plugins are written in haskell
13:42:14   +meskarune   and it also have multilanguage support
13:43:08   +meskarune   what features do we absolutely need in a wiki?
13:43:23   +meskarune   easy to update, secure
13:43:32        fsckd   yes
13:43:47        fsckd   imo the wiki is the most important are in project management
13:43:50   +meskarune   I would like to see some way to get update notifications
13:43:53   +meskarune   so its easy to mod
13:44:02   +meskarune   rss is nice, so would email or even irc updates
13:44:07        fsckd   (and todo lists which is what the tracker will be)
13:44:14        fsckd   area*
13:44:16   +meskarune   ++
13:46:21   +meskarune   moinmoin supports openid
13:46:49   +meskarune   maybe we can make a new issue called wiki and compare the features
13:46:57        fsckd   yeah, good idea
13:46:58   +meskarune   and figure out exactely what we need
13:47:06   +meskarune   and what features we don't really need
13:47:28        fsckd   i like git as part of the backup strategy
13:47:46        fsckd   though may be it is possible with moinmoin as it uses flat files
13:47:53   +meskarune   yeah, it makes it easy to download the backups to any computer
13:48:39   +meskarune   with a flat file based wiki, we can stick those on github too
13:49:05        fsckd   depends on what's in the files of course :)
13:49:12   +meskarune   yeah :)
13:49:20   +meskarune   and we have to be careful about it getting really huge
13:49:28   +meskarune   lots and lots of files can use up the server inodes
13:49:42   +meskarune   and lots of IO = slow server response time
13:49:45        fsckd   right
13:50:01   +meskarune   I acidentally used up all my space on another server because of munin stats
13:50:03   +meskarune   lol
13:50:06   +meskarune   20 GB of stats
13:50:15        fsckd   haha
13:50:19   +meskarune   LOL
13:50:31   +meskarune   we'll need to keep an eye on disk space
13:50:42   +meskarune   and hopefully get some hosting sponsors 
13:50:44   +meskarune   :)
13:50:48   +meskarune   so we can have moar data
13:50:53        fsckd   heh
13:52:43   +meskarune   there is also docuwiki
13:54:32        fsckd   it also uses flat files
13:55:03        fsckd   it's written in php
13:55:35   +meskarune   yeah, idk how secure it is
13:56:15        fsckd   moinmoin had a 0-day earlier this year
13:57:19   +meskarune   we'll look into it, maybe do some test installs, and see what would work best :)
13:57:29        fsckd   yeah, good idea
13:57:31   +meskarune   any other suggestions for issue tracking or wiki ?
13:57:35           *    MarkDude likes Media wiki ,but sees potential issues depending how editors/users are implemented. 
13:58:11   +meskarune   some troll does s/community/dong/g ?
13:58:17   +meskarune   :P
13:58:29     MarkDude   Moin has some hassles I remember from my Ubuntu stuff- a long time ago, in a galaxy far away :D
13:58:56   +meskarune   hehe
13:59:52   +meskarune   so next thing is the intership
14:00:48   +meskarune   google summer of code, gnome outreach program for women
14:01:21   +meskarune   I want to have an intership for doing code, web developement, maybe writting, etc
14:01:41   +meskarune   we need to define the program and requirements for applicants
14:05:46        fsckd   yeah. would they be paid?
14:06:16        fsckd   OPW pays. i don't know who funds.
14:06:17   +meskarune   If we can get some sponsors, and maybe apply to grants, I would really like to offer that
14:06:37   +meskarune   and we can apply to be a mentor?
14:06:51   +meskarune   we need to list the requirements and due dates
14:07:20        fsckd   yes
14:13:14   +meskarune   so we'll get that information together
14:13:32   +meskarune   and then we need to find people to help with meeting the requirements
14:15:36      manfred   w00t my head feels so much lighter, meeting still going on?
14:15:57        fsckd   yup
14:16:16        fsckd   we're talking about internships
14:18:52   +meskarune   if we find company sponsors, we could also maybe get a job referal system up
14:19:23   +meskarune   as another resource
14:32:36   +meskarune   so next is the mentorship program
14:32:39   +meskarune   :D
14:33:01   +meskarune   we can get a list of people willing to mentor, along with their skills, and match them with people who want to learn
14:33:21   +meskarune   I don't know if there is an application available for that or not
14:33:30   +meskarune   maybe some sort of simple social network?
14:34:17        fsckd   like linkedin?
14:34:35        fsckd   MarkDude: ping
14:35:00           *    MarkDude outlined 2 types of Mentoring on pad. I think both types would work. Some mentors could do both parts. I would be able to do FOSS stuff in general part
14:36:22     MarkDude   It would be the same "program" just with a list of what a person could help with. Mine would be a few types of wiki, being *front facing (Community, community)* and possibly other skills
14:36:38   +meskarune   we would also need a way for people to contact each other 
14:36:51   +meskarune   without revealing real life information, like email, etc
14:37:09   +meskarune   and if people are interested in real life meetups, we can match by location as well
14:37:36     MarkDude   A closed ML or sumthin' like that?
14:38:14     MarkDude   Part of this (at least for me) depends on HOW the next item is looked at
14:38:17   +meskarune   mailing list with a member direcotry or something?
14:38:25     MarkDude   As far as Ally type stuff
14:39:08     MarkDude   meskarune: that would make sense. I know in Fedora I do this via email, and a few prefer Facebook XD
14:39:45     MarkDude   Also phone, but that is for test I do to approve new ambassadors (not too relelvant to how this will be done for AW
14:40:51     MarkDude   Some folks will be ok with ML the group can see, and some will just want email only
14:41:01           *    MarkDude 's guess here :)
14:42:01     MarkDude   Key here for me, is getting folks to use some sortof compatible Linux (read in not always doing things in Ubuntu specific manner) 
14:42:17   +meskarune   ++
14:42:43     MarkDude   If Wayland keeps going  that is a Debian, Fedora, Arch, and others FOSS wide project
14:43:07     MarkDude   In a way keeping up the awesome Arch has best dos theme :)
14:43:40        fsckd   lol
14:43:47           *    MarkDude types this when he is done rambling  eof  (Fedora APAC meeting progress)
14:46:00     MarkDude   Oh, part of this depends on how AW describes membership ( Im assuming its just an opt-in)
14:47:27     MarkDude   Fedora is currently re-doing the Mentoring program- I will keep an eye out for relevant parts for AW. 
14:48:36           *    MarkDude 's thinks part of what should be done first - is define the FOSS-wide goal - similar to how BAMF has "Play well with others"
14:49:09     MarkDude   And then define what AW wants from new contribs/users/etc
14:51:24   +meskarune   lol sorry, had to grab some food
14:51:56   +meskarune   yeah, I think we need some sort of organization system as well as a system for people to contact each other
14:52:09   +meskarune   and in this situation, some people may not want themselves publicly known
14:52:26     MarkDude   Also the elephant in the room as far as Ubuntu goes. Currently I am pointing folks to Fedora or Deb
14:53:06     MarkDude   +1 - this could even be done on riseup pad if someone wanted - I think that would be edge case, but not too much of a hard option
14:54:09     MarkDude   Part of this is allowing people to build a trust level. Contact via irc, then do a pad. its gonna involve typing SOMEHOW
14:54:37   +meskarune   there is a social networking application called diaspora that is open source
14:54:55   +meskarune   with lots of privacy controls that are easy to manage
14:55:36     MarkDude   Email most likely. Fedora is chaging it to new person contacts Mentor- then the mentor creates a ticket (for AW this could be a diaspora account)
14:56:32     MarkDude   The reason for the change was that some found creating a FAS ticket was a hassle. I think having it open for new person to create account, and mentor helps if need be
14:56:45   +meskarune   yeah, that is true
14:57:16   +meskarune   and I'm sure that there will be more people wanting to learn than to mentor, so we will need to grow the network
14:57:21     MarkDude   Some people are brilliant, but hit roadblocks based on their own limitations (perceived or real)
14:58:04   +meskarune   yeah, and need encouragement and resources to take advantage of
14:58:27     MarkDude   It depends on how high the bar is to join. There has to be a bit of a hurdle to help weed out time vacuum folks that CANT google ever
14:59:22     MarkDude   The hurdle could be create a user page - with personal description. Or maybe just a paragraph on what a person wants to learn
15:00:27     MarkDude   Ubuntu's hurdle of LP account and using Moin to be official member is a real juxtaposition when you consider the Distro
15:01:51     MarkDude   Having a person make a Diaspora makes sense. There is a HUGE difference on how different Mentors teach people. They are refining it a bit after learning some more
15:02:36     MarkDude   ^^^ refer to Fedora (getting more coffee)
15:02:42     MarkDude   eof
15:04:50   Aster     So,oday, I explored Perl http://imgur.com/a/PAcSx
15:04:51        phrik   Title: Programming Signs - Imgur (at imgur.com)
15:06:01     MarkDude   XD
15:06:09      manfred   nice
15:06:45        fsckd   lol XD
15:08:13   +meskarune   ok, next item, how do allies fit in with arch women?
15:08:23   +meskarune   sorry, I'm running into some lag...
15:09:05     MarkDude   This ally thinks I fit in where asked :) 
15:09:46           *    MarkDude would still refer to himself as AW member even if the specific was ally
15:09:55   +meskarune   ++
15:10:11   +meskarune   I personally feel that it takes men and women both working together to make changes to equality
15:10:12     MarkDude   Similar to how I USED to say I waqs a straight ally for equlaity
15:10:53   +meskarune   the world isn't a single gender, and we all need to work together in the greater community
15:11:03     MarkDude   now I just advocate for equality, dont need to clarify my preference in dating- and I dont care if folks were to think I was gay
15:11:08        fsckd   the question of allies has come up every so often. particularly in every channel rules meeting :P
15:11:37   +meskarune   yeah, if we should have specific requirements for an ally vs. women identified members
15:11:42     MarkDude   Yep- that was my other thought. sexual identity is more than a binary thing
15:12:06           *    MarkDude DOES think the barrier for men to Mentor- SHOULD be higher
15:12:32     MarkDude   Its fair I have to prove I know 101 stuff, and at least part of Equality 201
15:12:33   +meskarune   yeah, its not going to be a dating service :)
15:12:45   +meskarune   and trolls love women's groups online
15:12:49     MarkDude   Yep
15:13:18        fsckd   !feminism101
15:13:19           *    MarkDude would like if I could use the title of Feminist Hulk 
15:13:20        phrik   http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Feminism_101
15:13:29   +meskarune   haha 
15:13:31           *    MarkDude can pass the 101 test
15:13:55        fsckd   !feminismfaq
15:13:58        phrik   http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/the-faqs/faq-roundup/
15:14:16           *    MarkDude can do well on part of 201 that apply to me (clothing tho is not something men should maybe ever speak on)
15:14:51     MarkDude   301 is where AW is IMHO. The idea of we are almost there, so act like it at times
15:14:55   +meskarune   ugh, yeah. I could die happy if I never heard "what are you wearing right now?"
15:15:24     MarkDude   Well more like when a woman was running for Vice president, and men complained about her clothes
15:15:34   +meskarune   ><
15:15:48   +meskarune   but dudes running for office wear the same outfit like EVERYDAY
15:15:50           *    fsckd tries not to mention France and fails
15:15:52           *    MarkDude was of opinion most men should shut up there - and stick to policy complaints
15:15:54   +meskarune   haha
15:15:58      manfred   meskarune: different ties
15:16:07   +meskarune   lol
15:16:10     MarkDude   Yep 3 suits- for the rest of your life men can do it
15:16:16      manfred   MarkDude: everyone should shut up and just care about policy, not just men
15:16:24   +meskarune   ++
15:16:48     MarkDude   Sure- agreed, I was more just pointing out I was telling men to shut up about things they dont understand
15:16:56   +meskarune   but the awful fashion sense and food choices are what is really important!
15:17:29   +meskarune   yeah, one of the great things about having allies - many times guys will be more responsive to another dude saying "hey, thats no ok, and this is why"
15:17:32      manfred   at the end of it, when hilary broke down and was crying, i just don't understand who wouldn't be have a mental breakdown at some point in a presidential race
15:17:33     MarkDude   Of course Im not saying inverse that all women are fashion experts - clot
15:17:35      manfred   shit is stressfull
15:17:43   +meskarune   and they can follow the example that other guys here set
15:18:16     MarkDude   Yep, and sometimes it takes a person with privilege to explain what that means
15:19:25     MarkDude   Unfortunately. But having done that- I have seen that open a persons eyes
15:19:28        fsckd   ok, i found it, the last time there was disagreement
15:19:56        fsckd   i still don't understand what was disagreed on. i think it had something to do with allies
15:20:36      manfred   fsckd: was this last months meeting?
15:20:47        fsckd   yeah that day
15:20:48      jy2wong   fsckd: something something men as explicit guests vs as equals in the channel
15:20:56      manfred   ^^^
15:21:07           *    MarkDude is not touching this with any pole....
15:21:09      manfred   the day I rage quit and the channel went silent?
15:21:15        fsckd   yes lol
15:21:52           *    MarkDude knows he is guest here - but I think of it due to my Fedora involvement- not my binary
15:22:44           *    MarkDude felt the need to explain a bit about Arch and AW at general Linux talk I gave to ITT tech
15:23:18      manfred   MarkDude: the discussion was mostly if people like me were guests or allies, some people thought i should be only a guests even though me and kaictl are putting together the classroom stuff
15:23:44     MarkDude   Split the difference- call everyone an advocate and still define mens hurdle as higher?
15:24:05     MarkDude   In other words - you and kaictl have proved some with your actions
15:24:15   +meskarune   I feel that primary contributers are members
15:24:25   +meskarune   and people who jump in occasionally are guests say
15:25:34        fsckd   one concern may be that men can dominate a space intended for women
15:26:16     MarkDude   Makes sense. fsckd that would be a 101 thing a man would have to be able to grok
15:27:32        fsckd   sometimes i wonder if i am dominating in any way; i like to be helpful but have i stepped too far?
15:28:03      manfred   fsckd: if you go to far, i will knife you ♥
15:28:19        fsckd   haha thanks XD
15:28:44     MarkDude   lol- that and feedback loops are good to listen to 
15:29:28           *    manfred feels a stabbing pain in his side from cold steel... maybe it is time to change the topic?
15:29:45        fsckd   lol
15:32:00     MarkDude   Well this issue is important to be sorted out, once the group has a consensus the other details may be easier to sort out
15:32:15        fsckd   yeah
15:32:32     MarkDude   UW women has a very heavy leaning to men are guests
15:32:48     MarkDude   And should also tiptoe around, IMHO
15:33:10      jy2wong   fsckd: IMO that's a legitimate concern, but I see no clear way of expressing or enforcing that as a channel rule.
15:33:49   +meskarune   also I don't want to segregate people
15:34:01     MarkDude   To the point it has hurt in PR. Well a rule about not dominating all the talk is fair- if its pointed out more to men so be it
15:34:05   +meskarune   we are all in the arch linux community and FOSS community and should work together
15:34:26   +meskarune   meh, we can just tell people to take off topic things to off-topic :)
15:34:36     MarkDude   Applies to everyone. Most men can grok the idea- of letting others speak
15:35:07   +meskarune   yeah, trying to include others in conversation instead of continuing a private conversation in channel
15:35:16   +meskarune   I've been in other irc channels where people did that
15:35:38   +meskarune   so when a new user comes in, we say hello, etc
15:35:47   +meskarune   but that is probably a rule for everyone
15:36:17     MarkDude   Looks like the idea here is: find ways to be inclusive, like asking for input of those that have not spoke... Define men as having higher hurdle to be in later to be defined Mentor program
15:36:43   +meskarune   also trolls in general :)
15:36:51   +meskarune   not all trolls are dudes 
15:37:28     MarkDude   But as a general member, maybe not the split, that might work with the group. Its NOT the biblical baby - it could be split :D
15:37:49      jy2wong   MarkDude: I don't think that's terribly helpful. If you have one group treated as second class citizens, communication suffers and you just end up inverting the asshat pyramid rather than removing it.
15:38:04     MarkDude   Well Im suggesting just for Mentor
15:38:36     MarkDude   Or to make it equal- ALL potential Mentors would need to pass a simple 101 test
15:38:59     MarkDude   the fact men may know less there is on them - not AW making a split
15:39:45     Nisstyre   meskarune: what makes someone a member vs. a guest?
15:39:56   +meskarune   good question
15:39:59     MarkDude   Most women know this earlier in life than most men would. I mean it makes sense for me- were I talking about Go Daddy to not judge Danica Patrick on her looks- thats 101
15:40:34   +meskarune   guest is probably someone who jumps in to ask a question about the group, see what it is, or why it exists, but maybe isn't interested in staying or contributing
15:40:44     MarkDude   No need to have her value based upon looks, even if you are trying to tie in with GD and their BS :D
15:41:07     Nisstyre   What are some good games on GoG that work under WINE?
15:41:44        fsckd   Nisstyre: see topic ;)
15:42:04   +meskarune   haha
15:42:13   +meskarune   Nisstyre: ps, indie humble bunder games.
15:42:40     Nisstyre   meskarune: hmm, I have the one with psychonauts, and the first one (with Penumbra: Overture)
15:42:51     MarkDude   If guest was not based on personal plumbing, that would help draw folks to Arch, imho. Allowing a one time contribution is helepful and deserving of guest- or FOSS helper person, or some other touchy feely name
15:43:21     Nisstyre   oh is there a meeting going on or something?
15:43:25   +meskarune   yeah, some people may just want to make a one time payment or jump in to check out the community for someone else
15:43:34   +meskarune   like a wife or daughter 
15:43:40   +meskarune   LOL Nisstyre 
15:43:43   +meskarune   yes ;)
15:44:00   +meskarune   <3
15:44:11      manfred   longest meeting ever had here? was it that one week it was 6 hours?
15:44:24   +meskarune   LOL omg 
15:44:26   +meskarune   ><
15:44:31   +meskarune   yeaaaah
15:44:37        fsckd   i think it was 5 hours
15:44:44      manfred   close enough
15:44:47        fsckd   :P
15:44:49     Nisstyre   I think arch-women should promote ports of games with awesome female protagonists to Linux
15:44:51     MarkDude   If men are equals here, its due to AW treating its guests nicely, there is Women in title. And unlike Fedora Women- I can at least join here :D
15:44:53     Nisstyre   e.g. The Longest Journey
15:44:59     Nisstyre   doesn't play at all on WINE :(
15:46:09       kaictl   lol i go to sleep a couple of hours before the meeting, get a nice morning/afternoon's sleep, and wake up to catch the tail end of the meeting.
15:46:15       kaictl   haha
15:46:38   +meskarune   LOL
15:46:38        fsckd   lol
15:46:46   +meskarune   kaictl: we was talking about classroom eariler :P
15:47:00     Nisstyre   forgive my ignorance, but what's classroom?
15:47:04       kaictl   i see. i'll have to dig out my logs later. 
15:47:11      jy2wong   sorry, missed the classroom discussion
15:47:15     Nisstyre   I guess I could grep through my logs
15:47:24      jy2wong   but do y'all need any help with that?
15:47:24   +meskarune   Nisstyre: arch linux classroom - project to teach people stuff, like package building or programming
15:47:28     Nisstyre   not sure if I was joined actually
15:47:36   +meskarune   this would increase the number of people contribution to arch and foss
15:47:43     Nisstyre   meskarune: cool, are there some notes or something?
15:47:52   +meskarune   Nisstyre: #archlinux-classroom
15:47:57   +meskarune   there is a whole channel :D
15:48:07   +meskarune   also arch wiki page and forum thingy
15:48:14     Nisstyre   meskarune: is there a summary of the goals/methods somewhere?
15:48:16     Nisstyre   oh ok
15:48:32   +meskarune   it would be nice if classroom had a webpage maybe
15:48:33      manfred   kaictl: first weekend of august sound good to you?
15:48:40   +meskarune   just to show dates and general informatoin
15:48:41       kaictl   yup
15:48:47      manfred   meskarune: first weekend of august
15:48:49      manfred   makr it
15:48:51      manfred   mark*
15:48:54   +meskarune   kk
15:48:56   +meskarune   <3
15:48:57       kaictl   no, makr it.
15:48:59        fsckd   woohoo
15:49:01        fsckd   haha
15:49:02      manfred   marx it
15:49:51       kaictl   m rax it.
15:49:57     MarkDude   MarkDude it
15:50:19      manfred   kaictl: 6rax it
15:50:45       kaictl   manfred: nah. 1-1-1 it.
15:50:50      manfred   heh
15:50:55        fsckd   let me see if i can summarize
15:51:16      manfred   1) Fish are friends, not food
15:51:25     Nisstyre   meskarune: well if you need someone to teach functional programming via Scheme or something let me know
15:51:32        fsckd   men and women are equal here, people are distinguished by how much the contribute?
15:51:38     Nisstyre   that is mostly my area of expertise
15:51:47   +meskarune   Nisstyre: if you wanna, I'll support you in that endeavor
15:51:59     Nisstyre   meskarune: yeah, when I have free time
15:52:06     Nisstyre   I have something I'm working on for money
15:52:19   +meskarune   and contributing can be answering questions, welcoming others, adding to wiki, helping with meeting notes, etc
15:52:22     Nisstyre   but I would be willing to put aside some time
15:52:41      jy2wong   Nisstyre: I forget, did you go to waterloo or happen to be aware of the existence of waterloo?
15:52:47     Nisstyre   jy2wong: McMaster
15:52:51     Nisstyre   and I'm still going there
15:52:59     Nisstyre   I live near Waterloo though
15:53:04     Nisstyre   in the summer that is
15:53:14   +meskarune   see if they will fund you in teaching a class :) and we can help with hosting any docs or whatever
15:53:47   +meskarune   I'll even write you a ref if they need that for handing out funds. college is a great resource for that sort of thing
15:54:03     Nisstyre   meskarune: there is a CS outreach program meant for teaching kids, not sure if they could get *funding*, but maybe
15:54:53     Nisstyre   meskarune: I was thinking just write up some tutorials/docs to help people get started
15:54:54   +meskarune   hehe
15:55:13   +meskarune   fsckd: anyways, that sounds good to e fsckd 
15:55:55      jy2wong   I might possibly be convinced to run a 'wtf is a kernel' 101 some time in the future
15:55:58   +meskarune   and everyone should try to be inclusive and understanding in channel 
15:56:26     MarkDude   +1
15:56:34   +meskarune   if someone has a project idea they want to work on, please let the channel know
15:56:45   +meskarune   I want to support people's endeavors :)
15:57:12      manfred   jy2wong: do you know much about jprobes?
15:57:37      jy2wong   manfred: never heard of a jprobe.
15:57:43      manfred   ahh
15:58:00      manfred   it is what replaced overwriting the syscall table in the old kernel, now that the syscall table is read only
15:58:03      jy2wong   (qu'est-ce que c'est?)
15:58:11      manfred   like if you wanted to hook something into the kernels fork() call
15:58:22      manfred   i would be interested in some kernel stuff
15:58:59      manfred   (you use it to load into modules and overload functions but still feed to teh old function at teh end of your injection)
15:59:58      jy2wong   manfred: yar. (sounds more like 'beat linux kernel into submission 201' though.)
16:00:13   +meskarune   ya'll should jump into #archlinux-classroom if you aren't there :)
16:00:22      manfred   jy2wong: http://ix.io/6y3
16:00:30      manfred   jy2wong: yeah no, i would still be interested in what you were offering
16:00:44      manfred   i need to learn more about the kernel anyways
16:00:46      jy2wong   manfred: on phone. will check out later
16:00:50      manfred   ok :)
16:01:50      manfred   meskarune: which bug tracker did we decide to use? and do i need to patch up the rt4 aur package?
16:02:24      manfred   oh looks like someone already fixed it
16:02:27   +meskarune   manfred: haven't decided yet, but request tracker does look nice
16:02:29   +meskarune   :)
16:02:31      manfred   just a few . releaces out of date
16:02:32   +meskarune   manfred: sweet
16:02:38      manfred   yar
16:02:44     Nisstyre   jy2wong: how about something on "How to write a device driver for C noobs" ?
16:03:21        fsckd   ok bug in riseup pad
16:03:27   +meskarune   oh no
16:03:27      jy2wong   Nisstyre: probably 'what is an device driver' should come first.
16:03:34     Nisstyre   true
16:07:28   +meskarune   ok, lets wrap up the meeting
16:07:38   +meskarune   Final comments, questions, concerns?
16:07:38        fsckd   :)
16:07:42      manfred   elephants?
16:07:57        fsckd   what do you mean by, "FOSS is mostly male, so it would make sense to have men involved and making change within their own circles." ?
16:08:07      manfred   (epitaphs*)
16:08:29   +meskarune   so like, most free open source projects have mostly male members
16:09:10   +meskarune   if more guys get involved with increasing the involvement of women, they can affect the groups they are in
16:10:22        fsckd   as more women get involved, they will replace the guys?
16:10:31        fsckd   in the group
16:10:38   +meskarune   with both genders working together, a wider range of people will be reached
16:10:52   +meskarune   not replace
16:11:02   +meskarune   I'd love to see 50/50 split with men and women
16:12:02        fsckd   i estimate it's about 20-30% women in here
16:12:19   +meskarune   in jobs and open source projects, its going to be half/half or mostly guys. so we need that support network in place, and guys are an important resource for that
16:13:33        fsckd   ok... hmm
16:13:34   +meskarune   yeah, I want to make some marketing material that people can download and use
16:13:50        fsckd   cool
16:13:51   +meskarune   so we can get the word out and recruit some more
16:13:58   +meskarune   using scribe probably
16:14:12        fsckd   what is scribe?
16:14:13   +meskarune   make some flyers and pampletes, etc
16:16:18   +meskarune   http://www.scribus.net/canvas/Scribus
16:16:19        phrik   Title: Scribus.net (at www.scribus.net)
16:16:22   +meskarune   sorry, scribus
16:16:30        fsckd   oh scribus heh
16:16:32   +meskarune   you use it to make print page layouts
16:16:37   +meskarune   pamplets, etc
16:16:44   +meskarune   can use inkscape also
16:18:41        fsckd   cool
16:19:01           *    MarkDude suggests we avoid a focus on metrics like UW. Thats a progress indicator, meaning if a man joins it ruins their goal
16:19:40   +meskarune   yeah, I agree
16:19:48     MarkDude   what % of AW is intersting, but UW is uses this as metric, its bad math
16:19:50     MarkDude   IMHO
16:20:24   +meskarune   we should be cognizant and try to recruit, but I think having guys out there and spreading the word will help us to reach more people and get more resources
16:20:42           *    MarkDude wants people to join- if we focus on cross section of population, and do things well - women, men and everyone will join :)
16:20:45   +meskarune   vs. only women
16:21:04   +meskarune   and we can all work together and have a great community and do lots of good
16:21:21           *    MarkDude feels the being selective on reaching out to men is implied and not need be codified
16:22:20     MarkDude   Oh +1 for mktg material, I will bring AW lit to all my events - same as I do with UW (need anyone think I am disparaging them) :)
16:22:54   +meskarune   I think there is a place for women only or women focused groups, and there are plenty out there
16:23:09           *    MarkDude likes UW, sees them as a good learning tool, and that each project decides WHAT they want for themselves
16:23:13   +meskarune   but for our goals, I think it would be more effective to be inclusive
16:23:35     MarkDude   Yes- especially teaching STEM to High school girls is example
16:24:28     MarkDude   Sometime the most effective thing is to NOT reinvent the wheel- and just point to groups that are geared towards differing goals - eof
16:24:45   +meskarune   yeah, I'm all for networking and sharing resources
16:25:14   +meskarune   fsckd: do you have any comments? 
16:25:26   +meskarune   also any other comments/questions/concerns ?
16:25:54      manfred   comments/questions/concerns/elephants

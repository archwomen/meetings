Arch Linux Women - Dec. 2, 2012 IRC Meeting

1)  Arch Linux Install Day
    Though the installs were not numerous, it was a great event
    Proposed having another install day in march
        Advertise it more
        Maybe have a class during the day that would basically be an overview of the install process and a q&a session and an intro to arch linux, meeting other people, etc

2) Site hacked 
    appears to be a PHP security hole in b2evolution
    meskarune has not found exactly where, we're only using 2 plugins
    person uploaded and index.html file and 2 folders, which superceded the index.php file.  the folders just have text files and images
    index.html is served before index.php.  all the site stuff is still there, they just added additional files.  they only got access to the main site directory, and not any of the subdomains

3) Migration to new server 
    The arch women site is moving to a VPS so  we can all have more control over the server.
    There's a placeholder page at http://198.74.62.52/
    Replacement for b2evolution needed to decided
    Pluses and minuses of static sites, b2evolution, wordpress, python and django were discussed
    It was decided that the site will use mezzanine for content management
    Email will stay on the old server for now; decision on what to use to handle it was postponed.

4) Draft channel rules 
    After much discussion, the drafting of the channel rules will be worked on outside of the meeting.

5) Arch Classroom
    gtmanfred has been working on it and said that everything is quieting for him this week, and he will be able to do teach the class and answer questions starting soon.  He was thinking around December 15th
    There is a dedicated channel, #archlinux-classroom

6) Other stuff
    Recruit some interns to help Arch Women?  
    A lot of schools require unpaid internships to graduate, maybe we could recruit studenst looking for internships to work on Arch stuff or Arch women stuff

    This would help out college students and Arch

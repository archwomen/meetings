2012-05-06 13:10:18  fsckd          we have a couple of ongoing projects
2012-05-06 13:10:34  carharttjimmy  for the record, they are?
2012-05-06 13:10:43  fsckd          i'm getting to that
2012-05-06 13:10:49  * fsckd types slooooooooooow
2012-05-06 13:10:55  carharttjimmy  alright
2012-05-06 13:11:11  * carharttjimmy sits back in his seat smoking a cigar looking like a fat cat businessman
2012-05-06 13:11:57  fsckd          the first project is classes tutorials for making PKGBUILDs
2012-05-06 13:12:10  fsckd          classes and tutorials*
2012-05-06 13:13:10  fsckd          the idea was to create and improve documentation
2012-05-06 13:13:39  carharttjimmy  on the pkgbuilds alright
2012-05-06 13:13:51  fsckd          yes
2012-05-06 13:14:03  fsckd          and have individuals give assistance
2012-05-06 13:14:22  carharttjimmy  the record states that joyfulgirl decided to do that and maybe ioni ?
2012-05-06 13:14:39  fsckd          yup 
2012-05-06 13:14:57  carharttjimmy  alright ioni after the reading of the minutes, we would like a progress report on your work
2012-05-06 13:15:11  fsckd          lol, ioni only volunteered to be a teacher
2012-05-06 13:15:31  carharttjimmy  still want to hear his ideas he has come up with
2012-05-06 13:15:37  fsckd          ok sure
2012-05-06 13:15:43  carharttjimmy  cant teach without making a plan
2012-05-06 13:16:22  carharttjimmy  Moving onto the next project. Shall we? Unless someone has something that they would like to add
2012-05-06 13:16:31  carharttjimmy  or to append the minutes
2012-05-06 13:17:09  * fsckd listens to crickets chirping
2012-05-06 13:17:32  carharttjimmy  alright lets say that all the minutes has been validated unless someone says otherwise
2012-05-06 13:17:52  carharttjimmy  I put the motion forward
2012-05-06 13:17:55  fsckd          heh fine with me XD
2012-05-06 13:18:03  carharttjimmy  take that as a second
2012-05-06 13:18:11  carharttjimmy  anyone have any objections?
2012-05-06 13:18:56  carharttjimmy  Take that as none.
2012-05-06 13:19:01  fsckd          i think that cricket over there... no no it was cleaning its wings
2012-05-06 13:19:08  carharttjimmy  Motion passes due to no one objecting
2012-05-06 13:19:16  carharttjimmy  ioni: you around?
2012-05-06 13:19:45  ioni           depends
2012-05-06 13:19:51  ioni           do i have to do anything?
2012-05-06 13:20:14  carharttjimmy  Just say what you have figured out what you would include and do in your class
2012-05-06 13:20:25  carharttjimmy  that you would teach
2012-05-06 13:21:22  <-- Brookie (~sleeze@adsl-68-254-163-245.dsl.milwwi.ameritech.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2012-05-06 13:21:55  carharttjimmy  or you can say that you forgot about it.
2012-05-06 13:22:08  fsckd          anyways, basically, the last month has been a slow one due to a few people having personal issues, aka rl got in the way
2012-05-06 13:22:31  carharttjimmy  So, we should ban rl for the archwomen community
2012-05-06 13:22:36  carharttjimmy  from*
2012-05-06 13:22:38  ioni           nobody told me that i have deadlines
2012-05-06 13:22:42  fsckd          lol
2012-05-06 13:22:49  carharttjimmy  hmm, I see...
2012-05-06 13:22:54  fsckd          the current projects are long term ones
2012-05-06 13:23:00  ioni           obvious i did not prepare anything
2012-05-06 13:23:01  --> Brookie (~sleeze@adsl-68-254-168-96.dsl.milwwi.ameritech.net) has joined #archlinux-women
2012-05-06 13:23:16  carharttjimmy  yes but even with longterm projects some progress should be made
2012-05-06 13:23:23  carharttjimmy  but its cool
2012-05-06 13:23:36  fsckd          we're missing a few key people
2012-05-06 13:23:38  carharttjimmy  just think of some ideas sometime, and you are done.
2012-05-06 13:23:44  carharttjimmy  yes, we are.
2012-05-06 13:23:45  ioni           i'm more into being available to respond to questions than taking a lesson
2012-05-06 13:23:57  carharttjimmy  that'll do ioni
2012-05-06 13:24:05  carharttjimmy  thats progress
2012-05-06 13:24:20  carharttjimmy  we have an idea for the class, a question based thing.
2012-05-06 13:24:25  fsckd          that was established in the last meeting ;)
2012-05-06 13:24:48  carharttjimmy  heh we'll we can always establish it in this meeting's minutes
2012-05-06 13:24:57  carharttjimmy  again
2012-05-06 13:25:01  fsckd          lol
2012-05-06 13:25:23  carharttjimmy  alright, if that sums it up.
2012-05-06 13:25:36  carharttjimmy  How did everyone like tigr's post on online privacy?
2012-05-06 13:26:33  fsckd          it's good :)
2012-05-06 13:26:44  ioni           no idea
2012-05-06 13:26:48  ioni           she posted?

2012-05-06 13:31:04  carharttjimmy  Alright, meskarune how goes the SSL conversion?
2012-05-06 13:31:04  <-- Sherry (~sherry@2.183.19.237) has quit (Ping timeout: 265 seconds)
2012-05-06 13:31:25  meskarune      apache is set up, and the files are made
2012-05-06 13:31:48  carharttjimmy  alright sweet
2012-05-06 13:31:48  meskarune      I just have to read though b2evolutions man pages to figure out what php files to edit
2012-05-06 13:32:02  carharttjimmy  so progress is going perfectly
2012-05-06 13:32:02  meskarune      I'm gonna make a copy of the whole site and stick it on git I think
2012-05-06 13:32:18  carharttjimmy  thats awesome
2012-05-06 13:32:24  fsckd          the blog posts too?
2012-05-06 13:32:53  meskarune      the blog posts are in a mysql database, but I could probably put those on git as well
2012-05-06 13:33:20  carharttjimmy  so shall it be irc-ed, so shall it be done
2012-05-06 13:33:30  meskarune      hehe
2012-05-06 13:33:48  fsckd          eh, nvm what i said, mysql db is not something you stick in git
2012-05-06 13:33:48  carharttjimmy  How goes the mailing list?
2012-05-06 13:33:49  meskarune      so what have you discussed so far
2012-05-06 13:34:00  carharttjimmy  we just harrassed ioni thats about it
2012-05-06 13:34:03  carharttjimmy  read the minutes
2012-05-06 13:34:04  meskarune      I'm so out of it today, I got back home late yesterday and just slept
2012-05-06 13:34:14  carharttjimmy  and then harrassed ioni some more
2012-05-06 13:34:39  carharttjimmy  I say that all people on projects should have something to say at each meeting on progress
2012-05-06 13:34:50  carharttjimmy  so we know where we stand
2012-05-06 13:34:50  meskarune      sounds good
2012-05-06 13:35:49  carharttjimmy  alright, how goes the mailing list meskarune ?
2012-05-06 13:36:24  meskarune      I haven't heard anything about getting on the main arch list
2012-05-06 13:36:35  meskarune      so I guess I'll set up something on our server
2012-05-06 13:36:38  carharttjimmy  then lets make our own
2012-05-06 13:36:43  carharttjimmy  perfect.
2012-05-06 13:36:59  fsckd          iirc the site's host allows unlimited mailing lists
2012-05-06 13:37:12  carharttjimmy  Alright, sweet.
2012-05-06 13:37:39  Silvah         carharttjimmy: a'ight, CJ
2012-05-06 13:38:14  carharttjimmy  Alright the last but is calendars and stuff, any progress on that?
2012-05-06 13:38:26  meskarune      no I haven't thought on it
2012-05-06 13:38:28  carharttjimmy  s/but/bit
2012-05-06 13:38:44  meskarune      I could transfer the email account to google apps and use though
2012-05-06 13:38:47  meskarune      those
2012-05-06 13:38:53  meskarune      but I was trying to stay all open source
2012-05-06 13:39:17  Silvah         Don't be religious.
2012-05-06 13:39:19  carharttjimmy  Alright, then at the next meeting, I want a debriefing on all possible routes.
2012-05-06 13:39:28  carharttjimmy  so we can decide

2012-05-06 13:40:43  meskarune      maybe zimbra calendar?
2012-05-06 13:41:01  carharttjimmy  what does it have?
2012-05-06 13:43:14  carharttjimmy  I would like to note that the agenda for this meeting has not been laid out, so we are playing by ear for now. We can all blame fsckd for not doing it :P
2012-05-06 13:43:35  Silvah         It's fsckd's fault!
2012-05-06 13:43:44  meskarune      my computer almost crashed ><
2012-05-06 13:43:51  fsckd          i blame Allan

2012-05-06 13:44:26  Silvah         !give carharttjimmy dice
2012-05-06 13:44:28  phrik          carharttjimmy: * phrik rolls a huge 600 side die and it flattens ioni before coming to a halt on 'You Lose'.
2012-05-06 13:44:44  fsckd          lol
2012-05-06 13:44:53  carharttjimmy  I second myself and pass the motion
2012-05-06 13:45:02  carharttjimmy  Its now allan's fault.
2012-05-06 13:45:04  camilasan  phrik: I love you too
2012-05-06 13:45:09  Silvah         ioni, that's close enough to Allan.
2012-05-06 13:45:30  Silvah         BACK TO TOPIC!
2012-05-06 13:45:35  carharttjimmy  alright back to topic

2012-05-06 13:46:08  carharttjimmy  why should we go with zimbra?
2012-05-06 13:46:17  ioni           don't
2012-05-06 13:46:28  ioni           you really want to maintain a server?

2012-05-06 13:48:55  joyfulgirl     I'm afraid I have to confess I made exactly no headway on my project; generally, when I've been online, I've mostly been occupied writing cover letters and such.
2012-05-06 13:49:18  ioni           joyfulgirl, we definitely should run together :P
2012-05-06 13:49:19  carharttjimmy  thats still a report joyfulgirl . Thank you for your honesty
2012-05-06 13:49:48  ioni           carharttjimmy, you did not thank for my honesty :(
2012-05-06 13:50:01  Silvah         carharttjimmy: that was mere irony, no need to excomunicate me.
2012-05-06 13:50:02  carharttjimmy  The next meeting we have, I would like everyone to give a little something about any progress or no progress on your projects
2012-05-06 13:50:13  carharttjimmy  It was a joke Silvah

2012-05-06 13:50:45  meskarune      joyfulgirl: its alright, I feel I haven't made a ton of progress either, but its been a hard month since there have been personal stuff going on with many of our members
2012-05-06 13:50:45  ioni           pff
2012-05-06 13:51:07  carharttjimmy  yes which leads me to our next vote

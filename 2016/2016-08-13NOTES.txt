    * Have a section or article on conflict resolution.
    * Meeting to discuss, hash out, and update on Tuesday, August 16th at around 22:00 UTC.

Classroom
  * License for class materials will be CC BY-NC-SA for future classes.
    * A single license for all classrooms for simplicity and ease of reusing materials or remixing from different classes.
    * ArchWiki interchangeability is no longer a consideration. The ArchWiki's goal is to document Arch specific things for software, not really compatible with hosting tutorials and class materials.
    * The license of past classes will be determined on a case by case basis.
  * Lets find some teachers for bash and PKGBUILD.
    * halosghost and meskarune are willing to help with a PKGBUILD class.
  * Someone has volunteered to teach a prompt customization class.

Mentoring
  * Add more mentors to the wiki page. Also looking for people to volunteer as mentors. Mentor identities are not public.
    * halosghost and pid1 volunteer.
  * Mentee and mentor sign up forms.
    * Preference for similar background/experiences, gender, a mentor who is LGBTQA.
    * TODO fsckd will draft posts for discussion on the AW mailing list.
  * Setup email group for mentor program - mentorship@archwomen.org, maybe have a mailing list thread?
    * Public contacts who are prepared to deal with conflicts, abuse, etc.

Final comments, questions, etc.

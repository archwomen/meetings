Arch Linux Women - 7th April, 2013 - 14th IRC meeting

Server
 * Security - intrusion detection
   * The server has been under constant attack since it went live
   * Security options: tripwire, aide, logwatch
   * Intrusion detection: we run "w" on each login
 * Resource monitoring
   * munin, awstats
 * Blog - garlicpress, static site generator
   * We created a fork of letterpress and calling it Garlicpress.
   * It runs as a service, watches for file changes, and automagically updates the blog when file updates are made.
   * People can make a post in markdown, git push, and bam, blog is updated.
   * The generator is a single python program with 2 dependencies.
   * Much discussion about possible garlicpress improvements.
     * Proposed future (add to redmine issue tracker)
     * Sphinx or pelican instead of markdown
     * Use git hooks (post_receive) to update static site instead of running a server. This is simpler.
   * Discussion of whether to allow blog comments and how to moderate them
     * Are comments needed?
     * How to moderate them and how to prevent spam?
       * CAPTCHA to block spam.
     * Proposed comment systems: email (mailing list), various git schemes.

Status on other stuff
 * Redmine upgraded
   * Redmine updated due to security issues.
   * Will update again to 2.3.x branch in April.
   * fsckd is working on an update wizard.
 * Git repositories - managed by Gitolite
   * Most server changes are through git; people can contribute without needing shell access.
   * Migration to new post-receive is (99%) complete.
 * calendar.archwomen.org
   * Created, need to make git repo and hooks, and add calendars.
   * Do we want a caldav server? We can just use zoho + desktop clients.
 * news.archwomen.org
   * Installed, needs git repos.

Projects
 * Classroom
   * PKBUILD class postponed.
   * Depending on things...may be postponed for a while.
   * Pacman 4.1 has been released.  We had been waiting on that as well.
     * Lets work on docs!!!

Community
 * Channel bot
   * Should we remove Phrik from #archlinux-women and have our own channel bot? 
     * Phrik has a lot of cruft.
   * Phrik can have factoids and quotes removed.
   * If phrik is harming greater arch linux community, should be changed instead of just blocked from channel completely.
   * Decided to talk to other arch OP's and get opinions
 * Progress on community standards (includes channel etiquette, blog rules, etc.).
   * There is (or will be) a redmine project.
   * Encourage people to add to it.
   * Get more examples, like from linuxchix, ada initiative, etc.
   * Consequences of violating:
   * Example progression is warning first, then kick, then ban.
     * Quiet for flooding.

Final comments, questions, etc.
 * Change meeting format
   * Announcements
   * Status updates
   * Discussion
   * Questions/extras

2013-06-02 12:12:52	+meskarune	ok, first items on the Agenda: Announcement and status updates
2013-06-02 12:13:34	+meskarune	fsckd: wanna talk about your awesome irc bot?
2013-06-02 12:13:41	fsckd	hehe
2013-06-02 12:13:48	fsckd	it's in progress :P
2013-06-02 12:13:53	+meskarune	:D
2013-06-02 12:14:10	fsckd	i'll let you know by the end of the week if it can replace phrik
2013-06-02 12:14:33	+meskarune	ok
2013-06-02 12:14:38	fsckd	i'm making it extendable so features can be added
2013-06-02 12:14:41	+meskarune	you are writing it in haskell ?
2013-06-02 12:14:49	+meskarune	extensible is great :D
2013-06-02 12:14:56	fsckd	right now i'm focusing on replacing the existing awbots
2013-06-02 12:14:59	fsckd	yes, haskell
2013-06-02 12:15:34	fsckd	because there's too much free disk space on the server :P
2013-06-02 12:16:41	+meskarune	https://github.com/archwomen/awbot
2013-06-02 12:16:43	phrik	Title: archwomen/awbot Â· GitHub (at github.com)
2013-06-02 12:16:44	+meskarune	LOL fsckd 
2013-06-02 12:17:50	+tigrmesh	hehe
2013-06-02 12:18:14	fsckd	the haskell code isn't on the site yet. that which meskarune linked to is the code for the existing bot
2013-06-02 12:18:36	fsckd	which will be replaced
2013-06-02 12:18:37	+meskarune	^
2013-06-02 12:19:21	+tigrmesh	in its infancy and already deprecated   
2013-06-02 12:19:22	+tigrmesh	;)
2013-06-02 12:19:29	fsckd	haha
2013-06-02 12:22:02	+meskarune	so the bot will make the channel easier to mod, be informative, hopefully people can look at the code and learn, and it will be fun :D
2013-06-02 12:22:25	fsckd	yeah :)
2013-06-02 12:22:27	terra-and-luna	Superficial question: will it have quote support?
2013-06-02 12:22:34	fsckd	i hope so
2013-06-02 12:22:46	terra-and-luna	(and yeah, I look forward to browsing the code)
2013-06-02 12:23:00	+tigrmesh	does informative mean easily added factoids?
2013-06-02 12:23:27	fsckd	i hope so!
2013-06-02 12:23:33	+tigrmesh	yay
2013-06-02 12:23:39	+meskarune	it can also post announcements like blog posts, git updates, etc :D
2013-06-02 12:23:45	+tigrmesh	cool
2013-06-02 12:24:01	+meskarune	I want to learn haskell, so I might jump in amd make some simple things :)
2013-06-02 12:24:06	+tigrmesh	:)
2013-06-02 12:24:17	+meskarune	I've never used a functional lang before 
2013-06-02 12:24:19	+meskarune	lol
2013-06-02 12:24:35	+tigrmesh	anyone who wants to can added patches and bits of code too, right?
2013-06-02 12:24:44	fsckd	yeah
2013-06-02 12:25:03	fsckd	right now i've left stuff closed because i've been rehauling stuff every few days
2013-06-02 12:25:20	fsckd	when the code is more stable (i hope this week) i'll put it on github
2013-06-02 12:25:40	+meskarune	sounds good
2013-06-02 12:25:43	+meskarune	ps: lag
2013-06-02 12:25:48	+meskarune	might be on and off T_T
2013-06-02 12:25:58	terra-and-luna	yay, githubbing~
2013-06-02 12:25:58	fsckd	ok
2013-06-02 12:26:27	fsckd	heh
2013-06-02 12:26:30	+meskarune	thanks fsckd 
2013-06-02 12:26:38	fsckd	:D
2013-06-02 12:27:34	+meskarune	ok, next announcement
2013-06-02 12:27:42	+meskarune	site is now secured with SSL!
2013-06-02 12:27:49	+tigrmesh	yay!!!
2013-06-02 12:27:59	+meskarune	if you go to http, it is redirected to https :D
2013-06-02 12:28:12	+meskarune	SSL is important for privacy and security
2013-06-02 12:28:48	terra-and-luna	Yup. Noticed it earlier today. S'nice.
2013-06-02 12:28:52	+meskarune	the certificate is good for 4 years
2013-06-02 12:29:22	fsckd	sweet
2013-06-02 12:30:52	+tigrmesh	is that why you had to do things like switch  redmine.archwomen.org  to  archwomen.org/redmine ?
2013-06-02 12:31:20	fsckd	yes
2013-06-02 12:31:35	fsckd	subdomains are not covered by the cert
2013-06-02 12:31:54	fsckd	(those cost waaaaay more)
2013-06-02 12:31:56	+meskarune	we should also probably enable hsts on the server
2013-06-02 12:32:05	+meskarune	yeah, wild card SSL certificates
2013-06-02 12:33:44	ioni	one from starssl is not that expensive
2013-06-02 12:34:01	ioni	startssl.com
2013-06-02 12:34:15	ioni	60$ for 2 years
2013-06-02 12:35:30	ioni	but now that you invested in another one, that's fine as well :D
2013-06-02 12:35:53	+meskarune	lol
2013-06-02 12:36:58	+meskarune	for $37 I got a cert for 4 years
2013-06-02 12:37:08	+meskarune	i would have gotten a wild card if i had the money
2013-06-02 12:38:46	+meskarune	we also changed the site structure into sub directories intead of subdomains so everything will be covered by the certificate
2013-06-02 12:39:09	fsckd	yeah
2013-06-02 12:41:36	+meskarune	ok, any other announcements?
2013-06-02 12:42:32	fsckd	i guess that's it

2013-06-02 13:23:43	vodik	fsckd: what are you using for the db layer?

2013-06-02 13:28:41	carharttjimmy	I work with TSQL at work, and SQL doesnt change syntax that much

2013-06-02 13:31:33	vodik	fsckd: then you don't need to know SQL. its a ORM
2013-06-02 13:31:51	fsckd	since we're in the middle of a meeting, midn if the bot discussion is moved to #archlinux-women-dev ?
2013-06-02 13:31:56	fsckd	mind*
2013-06-02 13:32:24	vodik	fsckd: no. but thats really all i had to ask. i havn't read it yet and im not going to much more today :P
2013-06-02 13:32:31	fsckd	hehe
2013-06-02 13:32:34	vodik	carry on :P
2013-06-02 13:32:42	carharttjimmy	Will SQL be needed for the webserver since we have to store data and such, and we will need to keep it encrypted for security purposes?

2013-06-02 13:44:08	carharttjimmy	ahh, I see
2013-06-02 13:44:27	carharttjimmy	why no postgres sql ?
2013-06-02 13:44:33	+meskarune	next thing is channel rules and guidelines
2013-06-02 13:44:45	+meskarune	carharttjimmy: we can discuss switching to that 
2013-06-02 13:44:54	+meskarune	maybe join -dev :D

2013-06-02 13:48:59	+meskarune	I'm not a good writer, so it would be helpful to have someone who IS good at writting help with getting the thoughts down in an intelligible way
2013-06-02 13:50:20	carharttjimmy	I write rather well. 
2013-06-02 13:50:33	carharttjimmy	Just tell me what you want and I can work on a draft :) 
2013-06-02 13:50:44	carharttjimmy	unless someone else wants to do it
2013-06-02 13:50:53	carharttjimmy	then I will stay around as a backup :)
2013-06-02 13:51:54	terra-and-luna	Not all of these will fit, but I do think the ##femninist rules are a good springboard https://github.com/freenode-feminists/freenode-feminists.github.com/wiki/Rules

2013-06-02 14:09:16	carharttjimmy	yeah good point, which brings me to an idea

2013-06-02 14:13:44	+tigrmesh	the problem i have withe the rules is the line about men being guests
2013-06-02 14:13:49	+tigrmesh	that bothers me a lot
2013-06-02 14:14:07	+tigrmesh	that's the one that most needs to be removed or reworded

2013-06-02 14:14:39	carharttjimmy	if we want there to be equality and such in the community, than we can't really treat some people as guests. It would discredit our intentions imho. 
2013-06-02 14:15:08	carharttjimmy	Its only when we all work together regardless of anything, that we can progress to a true state of equality among everyone. 
2013-06-02 14:15:21	carharttjimmy	wouldn't you agree tigrmesh ?
2013-06-02 14:15:38	terra-and-luna	Made it a point to say that not all of them would apply here.
2013-06-02 14:15:56	+tigrmesh	carharttjimmy: yes
2013-06-02 14:16:44	 *	yardena supports the idea of men being guests in #archlinux-women and is bothered opposite-ly to tigrmesh
2013-06-02 14:17:10	+tigrmesh	we are absolutely in opposition on this one
2013-06-02 14:17:41	carharttjimmy	Well, in the spirit of discussion, could both of you layout your reasoning? 
2013-06-02 14:18:01	+tigrmesh	imo, men are our allies, and men who love someone female that they want to encourage to use arch, are our most important friends
2013-06-02 14:18:12	yardena	i think that's an important debate to have but doesn't need to derail the current meeting
2013-06-02 14:18:43	carharttjimmy	Okay fair enough, after said meeting.
2013-06-02 14:19:10	carharttjimmy	s/said meeting/this meeting
2013-06-02 14:19:23	+tigrmesh	clearly we need to have a discussion about this.  should it be set for a particular later time?  or is after this meeting good?
2013-06-02 14:19:38	yardena	up to you
2013-06-02 14:20:30	yardena	i only bring it up to establish / reiterate that not everybody agrees
2013-06-02 14:20:59	+tigrmesh	carharttjimmy: you available after this meeting?
2013-06-02 14:21:08	carharttjimmy	We should have an architecht to keep everything written in blogs, codewise, and such fit a particular orderly form and standard. So, everything can look great and professional. 
2013-06-02 14:21:12	carharttjimmy	tigrmesh: yeah, I am.

2013-06-02 14:32:55	+tigrmesh	i guess they're afk

2013-06-02 14:33:12	+tigrmesh	moving on, GSoC research update
2013-06-02 14:33:41	+tigrmesh	the deadline for projects has passed
2013-06-02 14:35:26	+tigrmesh	however, i have some items to make a wiki page, including what the interns (don't remember what they're called off the top of my head) are supposed to do in addition to coding, with some examples
2013-06-02 14:36:41	+tigrmesh	they're supposed to blog about their experience and something else (which i also don't remember.  nor do i remember where my notes are, atm)
2013-06-02 14:36:50	+tigrmesh	that's my update
2013-06-02 14:36:54	+tigrmesh	any questions?
2013-06-02 14:38:42	carharttjimmy	who are the interns?
2013-06-02 14:39:30	terra-and-luna	Have they been decided? Can one still apply? Are they even a thing right now?
2013-06-02 14:39:32	+tigrmesh	as far as i know, there have never been interns for arch
2013-06-02 14:39:53	+meskarune	bah, back online
2013-06-02 14:40:24	carharttjimmy	if you do interns, you have to find a way to compensate per US Law
2013-06-02 14:40:53	carharttjimmy	though compensation can be anything...
2013-06-02 14:41:09	+tigrmesh	i think they do get money

2013-06-02 14:42:46	+meskarune	so teaching a person arch packaging as an internship = they are learning something useful like bash
2013-06-02 14:42:55	+meskarune	and interns can get college credit
2013-06-02 14:43:00	carharttjimmy	yes
2013-06-02 14:43:09	+meskarune	or put it down on their resume for jobs
2013-06-02 14:43:13	+tigrmesh	well, gsoc is only for working on open source projects
2013-06-02 14:43:13	carharttjimmy	but unpaid internships are statistically more likely to not land you a job
2013-06-02 14:43:27	+tigrmesh	not for google
2013-06-02 14:43:29	carharttjimmy	compared to paid ones
2013-06-02 14:43:39	carharttjimmy	tigrmesh: yeah google is different, because they are google :P
2013-06-02 14:44:27	carharttjimmy	in fact, if you do an unpaid internship, you are paying to work.
2013-06-02 14:44:45	carharttjimmy	because you still have to pay the college/uni for said credit :/

2013-06-02 14:48:08	+meskarune	if we find a way to generate funds, we can pay interns
2013-06-02 14:48:14	+meskarune	but lets get the program started first :P
2013-06-02 14:48:25	+meskarune	maybe find some people we are willing to sponsor
2013-06-02 14:48:35	+tigrmesh	but there are programs that are interested in women or that we can hook on to
2013-06-02 14:48:38	+tigrmesh	like gsoc
2013-06-02 14:48:51	+tigrmesh	or opw
2013-06-02 14:49:08	+meskarune	yep
2013-06-02 14:49:09	+meskarune	++
2013-06-02 14:49:33	carharttjimmy	++
2013-06-02 14:49:58	+tigrmesh	fun fact:  in 2010, the oldest gsocer was 47
2013-06-02 14:51:33	--	fsckd is now known as PizzaTheHutt
2013-06-02 14:51:47	--	PizzaTheHutt is now known as fsckd
2013-06-02 14:52:25	fsckd	what will the interns do?

2013-06-02 14:52:48	 *	carharttjimmy needs a new green tea
2013-06-02 14:52:55	fsckd	lol
2013-06-02 14:53:42	carharttjimmy	at my internship, they gave me a project and told me to ask them for help. And, gave me some pointers and left me in control mostly. 
2013-06-02 14:54:13	carharttjimmy	and when I thought outside of the box, they said, sure, go ahead. And, yeah, rather fun. 
2013-06-02 14:54:18	+tigrmesh	terra-and-luna: i can't find it.  you can probably get a quick answer in #kde-women or #kde-soc.  in #kde-women, also ask about OPW
2013-06-02 14:54:56	carharttjimmy	Now my company uses AGILE development, so maybe thats why... or they just trust my skills :P
2013-06-02 14:55:03	+meskarune	that sounds awesome carharttjimmy 
2013-06-02 14:55:25	carharttjimmy	phrik: give meskarune g amtdirect 
2013-06-02 14:55:26	phrik	meskarune: AMTdirect: Leading Real Estate Management Software Provider: <http://www.amtdirect.com/>
2013-06-02 14:55:27	+meskarune	interns should be able to use the resources of the company to learn and grow, etc
2013-06-02 14:55:33	carharttjimmy	I work there.
2013-06-02 14:55:48	carharttjimmy	As a software developer intern :)
2013-06-02 14:55:51	+tigrmesh	fsckd: i'll read up more and give examples. one gsocer worked on the gnome-screen extension for GTD, and another worked on phonon
2013-06-02 14:56:07	fsckd	cool
2013-06-02 14:56:17	carharttjimmy	meskarune: we should encourage interns to take control of projects assigned to them, so they can gather experience. 
2013-06-02 14:56:26	+tigrmesh	they do!
2013-06-02 14:56:30	carharttjimmy	and we can facilitate thier learning and growth 
2013-06-02 14:56:35	+tigrmesh	at least the gsoc ones
2013-06-02 14:56:40	fsckd	but, umm, what will they do at archwomen? or will it be archlinux internships?
2013-06-02 14:56:49	carharttjimmy	yeah tigrmesh! thats sweet!
2013-06-02 14:57:39	+meskarune	fsckd: we could brainstorm projects :)
2013-06-02 14:58:03	fsckd	yes, that i think needs to be done first
2013-06-02 14:58:10	fsckd	can't have internships without projects
2013-06-02 14:58:14	carharttjimmy	^
2013-06-02 14:58:27	+meskarune	hi intern, what do you feel like doing today?
2013-06-02 14:58:29	fsckd	and sponsors will likely ask the same question as i
2013-06-02 14:58:30	+meskarune	;)
2013-06-02 14:58:36	terra-and-luna	* get main site back up * make classroom materials * help write code for whatever
2013-06-02 14:59:01	carharttjimmy	terra-and-luna: those would be nice. 
2013-06-02 14:59:05	fsckd	terra-and-luna: those are great
2013-06-02 14:59:24	terra-and-luna	...I should probably just tile this window and the window with the thing I'm drawing, so I don't have to keep switching between workspaces.
2013-06-02 15:00:25	fsckd	(ot: can probably give an eta for the main site)
2013-06-02 15:00:28	carharttjimmy	terra-and-luna: you can use the mouse to draw stuff? I am in awe. I always make horrible looking things... anyways back on track. So, if we do interns in coding, we will also need to zero in on a development cycle
2013-06-02 15:00:46	terra-and-luna	Drawing in paper notebook, with a pencil.
2013-06-02 15:01:01	carharttjimmy	because, interns will need to know how we do development aka agile or SDLC 
2013-06-02 15:01:07	terra-and-luna	I do have a tablet around here somewhere, for when I finally have the drive to start learning it with the GIMP.
2013-06-02 15:01:34	carharttjimmy	though I recommend agile for development because it eliminates the "not-my-job syndrome"
2013-06-02 15:01:43	carharttjimmy	and a lot of companies are using it

2013-06-02 15:03:06	carharttjimmy	the reason why I like agile is because it takes at least 4 weeks to produce functional, working code
2013-06-02 15:04:22	+meskarune	interesting
2013-06-02 15:04:37	+meskarune	is there an easy way to keep track of the timelines?
2013-06-02 15:04:58	carharttjimmy	timelines for projects?
2013-06-02 15:05:12	+meskarune	so we'll need a few people who are interested to maybe work on organizign the internship program :)
2013-06-02 15:05:30	+meskarune	you don't need experiance, just willingness to jump in
2013-06-02 15:05:46	carharttjimmy	well as an intern, I could offer my insights :)
2013-06-02 15:06:18	+tigrmesh	meskarune: an arch gsoc project and intern?
2013-06-02 15:10:54	+meskarune	yeah, that sounds good
2013-06-02 15:11:07	+meskarune	does Arch Linux have meetings?
2013-06-02 15:11:14	+tigrmesh	no
2013-06-02 15:11:17	+meskarune	or do they just plan things through the mailing list?
2013-06-02 15:11:19	+meskarune	oh ok
2013-06-02 15:11:25	+tigrmesh	i think so
2013-06-02 15:12:12	+tigrmesh	we'd have to either send to it or find a dev willing to.  perhaps ioni will when it's time and we're ready
2013-06-02 15:12:26	+meskarune	ok, sounds good
2013-06-02 15:13:12	+tigrmesh	final comments?
2013-06-02 15:13:45	+tigrmesh	questions?

2013-06-02 15:17:30	+tigrmesh	ioni:  when we're ready to propose a gsoc internship project, would you mail our proposal to the arch-dev-public list?
2013-06-02 15:17:50	+meskarune	ioni: google summer of code :)
2013-06-02 15:18:49	ioni	i'll see what i can do tigrmesh

2013-06-02 15:19:12	yardena	yes
2013-06-02 15:19:37	ioni	i'll forward first internally first
2013-06-02 15:19:38	yardena	is arch still looking for devs these days?
2013-06-02 15:20:04	yardena	do they only choose devs from among TUs or am I making that up
2013-06-02 15:20:11	carharttjimmy	you have to be a trusted user first 
2013-06-02 15:20:19	ioni	is not a must
2013-06-02 15:20:20	+meskarune	I know they really REALLY need help 
2013-06-02 15:20:30	carharttjimmy	ioni: oh.. I see
2013-06-02 15:20:30	ioni	but some of devs are from tu land

2013-06-02 15:21:16	terra-and-luna	that reminds me, i should finish looking at cower and contact him with my questions.
2013-06-02 15:21:34	yardena	but mostly i know where to focus and just need more time to do it
2013-06-02 15:21:45	+meskarune	yardena: the problem is that the more you know, the more you realize that you don't know :P
2013-06-02 15:22:10	yardena	indeed.

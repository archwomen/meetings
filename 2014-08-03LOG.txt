Log of Arch Women 29th IRC Meeting, August 3rd, 2014

19:02:08          fsckd  ============================ Batman^WMeeting Begins ============================
19:03:14          fsckd  There's only one announcement.
19:04:02          fsckd  the wiki was updated to the latest stable release of DokuWiki, "Ponder Stibbons"
19:06:13     +meskarune  the amazing fsckd updated it :P
19:06:49          fsckd  it wasn't much, just untar and change one config ;P
19:07:16          fsckd  it was my first time updating dokuwiki so it took longer than it should. next time will be much faster :)
19:08:13          fsckd  now onto our first ongoing project, Classrooms
19:08:26          fsckd  there are a couple of classes proposed
19:08:50          fsckd  hh4a is working on a class on awk/gawk
19:09:31          fsckd  he's not here today so may be we'll find out his progress some other
19:10:30          fsckd  it's ok to take as much time as needed. quality is more important than quantity ;)
19:11:14          fsckd  nisstyre is making a class, intro. to programming with scheme
19:14:00     +meskarune  sounds really exciting
19:14:16          fsckd  yeah, i want to take it
19:14:18     +meskarune  I only know how to do basic stuff with awk
19:14:28     +meskarune  and I don't know anything about scheme >.>
19:14:34     +meskarune  so would be cool to learn a little
19:14:42          fsckd  totally
19:15:26          fsckd  it's a functional language which means it functions better than non-functional languages :P
19:16:19     +meskarune  lol
19:16:28     +meskarune  haskell and erlang are also functional languages?
19:16:47          fsckd  yup
19:17:25     +meskarune  but scheme is older
19:17:49          fsckd  oh yeah, it is
19:18:04     +meskarune  do they need help?
19:18:26          fsckd  scheme is in the Lisp family while haskell is in the closely related ML family of languages
19:18:41          fsckd  meskarune: who needs help?
19:19:16         demize  anyone making a class.
19:19:20     +meskarune  yeah
19:19:26          fsckd  ahh, heh, sorry
19:20:03     +meskarune  if they want/need some help writing up the lesson maybe we could network on the forums
19:20:25         demize  Would be a good idea.. more persistent communications than IRC.
19:21:43          fsckd  yeah
19:26:39          fsckd  will have to talk to them when they're available
19:27:15     +meskarune  yeah, sounds good
19:27:36       nisstyre  fsckd: I'm here btw
19:27:54       nisstyre  meskarune: scheme is older but there are 7 standards
19:27:56          fsckd  hi nisstyre, thanks for being here :)
19:28:25       nisstyre  i.e. it's been updated 6 times
19:31:13     +meskarune  nisstyre: I am sorta on the side that a technology/language being around and developed for a while == its proved to be useful and there are more docs + examples available 
19:31:25       nisstyre  meskarune: yeah, that's right
19:31:41       nisstyre  also if you learn scheme then you can read lots of stuff in academia and understand it
19:31:46       nisstyre  so it opens you up to a lot of knowledge
19:32:02     +meskarune  that sounds like a good intro to scheme :)
19:33:09     halosghost  sorry for being late; I'm here as well
19:33:28     +meskarune  <3
19:33:54          fsckd  hey halosghost :)
19:34:04     halosghost  howdy, folks
19:38:36     +meskarune  ok, talking about awk and scheme class
19:38:51     +meskarune  so nisstyre do you need any help?
19:40:10       nisstyre  meskarune: not really, I just need free time/motivation to get something more ready. Actually I could teach it whenever people want really.
19:40:26       nisstyre  I had some example stuff I did a while ago that should be more than enough for one or two classes.
19:41:27          fsckd  it's up to you, when you feel its done. will want to schedule it one month in advance, so you'll have that extra time
19:41:35          fsckd  s/done/ready/
19:41:45       nisstyre  then we can schedule it for a month from now
19:41:54          fsckd  September?
19:41:57       nisstyre  yep
19:42:29          fsckd  what day and time would you like?
19:42:46       nisstyre  hmm
19:42:48          fsckd  btw, how long do you expect the class to be?
19:42:56       nisstyre  the fifth would probably work best
19:42:58     +meskarune  sounds good nisstyre :)
19:43:11          fsckd  Friday the 5th
19:43:15       nisstyre  it can go for an hour or more depending on how many people are around I guess
19:43:33          fsckd  the 5th is good, what time?
19:43:48       nisstyre  probably around 4pm would work
19:44:15     +meskarune  I added it to the meeting notes
19:44:16       nisstyre  I can't say *for sure* that would be the best time, but I can probably guess that would be best
19:44:25     +meskarune  ok, we can go with that for now :)
19:44:26          fsckd  what timezone is that?
19:44:32       nisstyre  EST
19:44:43          fsckd  UTC-4?
19:44:48       nisstyre  not sure
19:44:52          fsckd  heh
19:44:56       nisstyre  that sounds right though
19:45:08          fsckd  i don't know if Canadia has DST
19:45:09      +tigrmesh  on a friday?
19:45:21          fsckd  gotta get down on Friday

19:51:35          fsckd  jy2wong: do you call it EDT (Eastern Daylight Time)?

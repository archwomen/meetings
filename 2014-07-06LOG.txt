2014-07-06 17:28:23 <tigrmesh>	cool
2014-07-06 17:29:51 <tigrmesh>	do you think it would be good to have another pkgbuild or kernel class any time soon?
2014-07-06 17:30:17 <tigrmesh>	or better to wait?
2014-07-06 17:31:03 <tigrmesh>	fsckd, do you want to do the classroom announcements?

2014-07-06 17:32:05 <fsckd>	Anyone can teach a class even if there has been a similar class taught before. Don't wait for approval on the topic.

2014-07-06 18:11:40 <tigrmesh>	meskarune isn't here to give an update of what she's been up to
2014-07-06 18:12:48 <fsckd>	all i know is there was supposed to be a meeting last month which didn't happen
2014-07-06 18:14:27 <tigrmesh>	i don't feel comfortable to make plans for 2 people who aren't here
2014-07-06 18:14:44 <fsckd>	yeah
2014-07-06 18:15:18 <tigrmesh>	so i don't fee comfortable setting a meeting for the small workgroup 
2014-07-06 18:16:01 <tigrmesh>	i think we should postpone any discussion until next month
2014-07-06 18:16:45 <fsckd>	i am in favor. the workgroup meeting can be rescheduled then
2014-07-06 18:17:54 <tigrmesh>	although i volunteer to contact meskarune and carharttjimmy later in hopes they'd meet before next month
2014-07-06 18:18:06 <fsckd>	sure

Topics for discussion
	* Classroom - will know more later after gtmanfred and kaictl consult with each other.
	* Suggestion: have another Install Day
		* Have some special events where people talk about how to install and set up something. Examples: webserver, systemd-user, weechat. Have the same event held multiple times in the day to accommodate timezones far apart.
		* Buddy install events for difficult upgrade processes, e.g. /bin merge.
		* Someone could watch arch-dev-public mailing list for possible big issues and let us know ahead of time.
		* Have an install day about every 2 months, maybe we can have a wiki page with a list of helpful resources for people.
		* Tentative date for the next one: Sept. 28th.
	* Switch to PostgreSQL on dataserver - yay
	* Issue tracker to replace the issue tracker part of redmine.
		* Need to research and choose one.
			* To be done on August 11th at 16:00 UTC.
			* New suggestions:
				* List of issue trackers at http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/08/bug-tracking-system/
				* Duet - not open source or free, though http://www.duetapp.com/
				* ProjectPier
				* phpcollab
				* django-helpdesk
			* Criteria: low resource usage, easy to administrate (install, upgrade, etc.), easy to use (allow quick submission of proposals), custom statuses, list assigned issues to logged in user, support for multiple projects.
			* kaictl will test Trac - modules and whatnot for making Trac nicer - in systemd-nspawn.
			* meskarune, fsckd and tigrmesh will test Mantis in a systemd-nspawn instance, possibly on the Archwomen server.
	* Discussion of migrating Redmine data to Docuwiki:
		* Decisions made:
			* The Redmine wiki to Dokuwiki migration will be on August 10th.
			* Migration option 1:
				* people could just create pages even and cp data
			* Migration option 2:
				* make a script to walk through each wiki page and download the text version
				* have another script convert the markup (we can do some sed magic maybe to change the text files in Dokuwiki style)
				* internal links may need manual work
				* and of course putting pages into the right place
	* Blog is almost completely back up. Anyone willing to write a post and/or have any blog post ideas?
	* Suggestion: we need a mission statement, something that has a specific goal we can work toward and is quantifiable.
		* Deferred to next month's meeting.
	* Suggestion: mini class on using git so more people can add to Archwomen projects.
		* gtmanfred and kaictl can help.
		* Detailed discussion deferred to next month.
	* We need to make some marketing materials, artwork is available at https://archwomen.org/media/images
		* Deferred to next month's meeting.

Final comments, questions, etc.

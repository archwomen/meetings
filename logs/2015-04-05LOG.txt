2015-04-05 14:48:48	+tigrmesh	cool
2015-04-05 14:49:59	+meskarune	so for classes
2015-04-05 14:50:18	+meskarune	I don't think the folks are around atm
2015-04-05 14:50:52	+meskarune	but we were interested in video classes
2015-04-05 14:50:58	+meskarune	and looking into technology for that
2015-04-05 14:51:47	+meskarune	a few suggestions: using ffmpeg to stream video people can watch with mplayer/vlc, https://subrosa.io/, google hangouts
2015-04-05 14:52:16	+meskarune	for subtitles I think we could have someone get a class outline and type in what is being discussed
2015-04-05 15:02:40	alad	noob question, what program would you use to add/edit the subtitles?

2015-04-05 15:17:26	fsckd	cool find
2015-04-05 15:18:22	+meskarune	alad: I was thinking someone could put into a chat, like google hangouts supports video and text chat at the same time :)
2015-04-05 15:18:37	+meskarune	and then we can post the video and transcript laster
2015-04-05 15:18:39	+meskarune	later
2015-04-05 15:19:21	alad	ah

2015-04-05 15:20:31	fsckd	for video classes should there be guidelines for including blind and deaf users?
2015-04-05 15:20:41	+meskarune	yeah, def

2015-04-05 15:32:05	+meskarune	I've been posting on forums and reddit for software recomendations
2015-04-05 15:32:17	+meskarune	but I think there might actually be a gap in that technology
2015-04-05 15:34:34	+meskarune	I think having a policy would be great
2015-04-05 15:34:45	+meskarune	so we can ensure that all classes are accessible
2015-04-05 15:38:19	fsckd	yeah

2015-04-05 15:48:34	+meskarune	my browser is being wonky
2015-04-05 15:49:03	+escondida	hey
2015-04-05 15:50:45	+meskarune	aaaaand it crashed
2015-04-05 15:54:44	+meskarune	should I end the meeting?
2015-04-05 15:54:55	+meskarune	any other comments on video class or other things?
2015-04-05 15:56:44	nisstyre	is the meeting still going?
2015-04-05 15:56:48	+meskarune	lol yeah
2015-04-05 15:56:53	nisstyre	I was sleeping because of illness apparently
2015-04-05 15:57:24	+escondida	End it? I thought it was at GMT 6:00 == 1:00 here
2015-04-05 15:57:26	nisstyre	fsckd: I think accessibility is important for classes
2015-04-05 15:57:28	+escondida	Ah man
2015-04-05 15:57:32	nisstyre	IRC is pretty damn accessible already
2015-04-05 15:58:02	nisstyre	I'm not sure how good this is because I wrote it ages ago but https://github.com/nisstyre56/IRC-Speak

2015-04-05 15:58:10	nisstyre	also not sure if it still compiles
2015-04-05 15:58:23	nisstyre	(with the C++ library it needs)
2015-04-05 15:59:07	nisstyre	but if anyone wants to make it better and port it to other clients be my guest
2015-04-05 16:08:57	+meskarune	oh that looks awesome nisstyre 
2015-04-05 16:09:13	nisstyre	I wrote it like years ago though
2015-04-05 16:09:34	nisstyre	so espeak has probably changed or improved
2015-04-05 16:09:49	nisstyre	http://espeak.sourceforge.net/
2015-04-05 16:09:49	+meskarune	I didn't even know about that python library

2015-04-05 16:09:54	+meskarune	I mgiht have to play with it
2015-04-05 16:10:13	nisstyre	the best one I've ever heard is, sadly, google's
2015-04-05 16:10:32	nisstyre	because it has a massive corpus of data to train with
2015-04-05 16:11:00	+meskarune	yeah, and they use google voice
2015-04-05 16:11:11	nisstyre	but I think we should try to use free software first
2015-04-05 16:11:26	+meskarune	companies actually use their phone voice menu systems to get records of people talking to improve voice stuff
2015-04-05 16:11:50	+meskarune	the vox project is trying to get an open licensed voice corpus
2015-04-05 16:12:08	+meskarune	my dog is begging for turkey :<
2015-04-05 16:12:17	+meskarune	she loves chicken/turkey more than anything
2015-04-05 16:12:37	freaj	x)
2015-04-05 16:13:27	fsckd	nisstyre: awesome!
2015-04-05 16:14:10	fsckd	nisstyre: there's been interest in having video classes. if we do have video classes, i think they should be done accessibly.

2015-04-05 16:25:51	+meskarune	the nice thing about google hangouts, it can be used on a phone or computer and you can have text chat at the same time I believe
2015-04-05 16:26:05	+meskarune	but then you are using google and maybe not all browsers support it
2015-04-05 16:26:27	+escondida	Don't you have to access it using a browser, too?
2015-04-05 16:29:32	+meskarune	you can use an app on a phone, or a browser with the right plugins
2015-04-05 16:29:42	+meskarune	other options might be ekiga
2015-04-05 16:29:54	+meskarune	tox apparently doesn't have vid conferences yet
2015-04-05 16:30:11	+meskarune	and  https://subrosa.io/

2015-04-05 16:30:29	+meskarune	its supposed to be open source, but every time I try it my browser crashes T_T
2015-04-05 16:30:33	+meskarune	so idk
2015-04-05 16:30:42	+meskarune	maybe my netbook is just weak sauce
2015-04-05 16:33:03	fsckd	a strong sauce can overwhelm the flavours of the dish
2015-04-05 16:37:05	fsckd	here's a concern. if a deaf persons starts interacting with a teacher via text, can a blind person know what they are saying?
2015-04-05 16:37:17	fsckd	s/concern/question/
2015-04-05 16:38:45	+meskarune	I think the teacher could say "someone asked blah" and then answer in speech and text
2015-04-05 16:41:23	+meskarune	some video conference type things take questions on twitter/chat
2015-04-05 16:41:38	+meskarune	from people who watch but aren't like video chatting
2015-04-05 16:52:06	nisstyre	fsckd: isn't that what captions are for?
2015-04-05 16:52:18	nisstyre	in the absence of an accurate speech->text program someone can do it right?
2015-04-05 16:53:23	+meskarune	I'd be willing to type what people say
2015-04-05 16:53:37	+meskarune	I don't know sign so I couldn't do that
2015-04-05 16:54:22	fsckd	it can be tiring work. typing as fast as possible continuously for an hour.
2015-04-05 16:56:43	+meskarune	if I use auto complete software and voice to text that might help :)
2015-04-05 16:57:00	fsckd	cool
2015-04-05 16:57:34	+meskarune	https://code.google.com/p/autokey/

2015-04-05 16:57:56	+meskarune	I used text automation doing techincal support tickets
2015-04-05 16:58:12	+meskarune	and I think dragon naturally speaking works on linux
2015-04-05 17:01:39	fsckd	oh cool
2015-04-05 17:01:46	fsckd	that might work
2015-04-05 17:02:52	+meskarune	WAIT chrome supports speach input
2015-04-05 17:03:16	+meskarune	start it with --enable-speech-input
2015-04-05 17:03:23	+meskarune	and I can talk and have it render text
2015-04-05 17:03:26	nisstyre	meskarune: how about someone to just correct mistakes in the speech->text output
2015-04-05 17:03:32	nisstyre	that requires reading fast but not much typing
2015-04-05 17:03:42	nisstyre	also we can donate money so they can buy a better keyboard :p
2015-04-05 17:04:21	nisstyre	meskarune: that's pretty neat
2015-04-05 17:04:40	fsckd	nisstyre: that's also a good idea
2015-04-05 17:04:44	<<<	escondida (~joyfulgir@archlinux/op/escondida) has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.1.1)
2015-04-05 17:05:11	+meskarune	I had to use dragon in college when I hurt my wrist
2015-04-05 17:05:21	+meskarune	it worked pretty well I guess
2015-04-05 17:05:36	+meskarune	and maybe we can tag team in case my hands get tired typing lol
2015-04-05 17:05:46	fsckd	iirc it has to be trained. but that might be only for old versions.
2015-04-05 17:06:54	nisstyre	meskarune: if you use a good mechanical keyboard with light switches, and don't put too much pressure on the keys then you can type for a pretty long time
2015-04-05 17:06:57	nisstyre	and pretty fast
2015-04-05 17:07:53	+meskarune	yeah, I've wanted a mech keyboard for a long time
2015-04-05 17:07:57	+meskarune	but they are so much money
2015-04-05 17:08:04	nisstyre	yeah I spent $100 on mine
2015-04-05 17:08:29	nisstyre	I've had it for almost 2 years though
2015-04-05 17:08:42	nisstyre	still works perfectly
2015-04-05 17:08:53	+meskarune	yeah, I mean, those things should last a really long time :)
2015-04-05 17:09:06	+meskarune	like at least 10 years lol
2015-04-05 17:09:12	nisstyre	yeah it's supposed to last a ridiculous number of keystrokes
2015-04-05 17:09:18	nisstyre	like 100 million or something idk
2015-04-05 17:09:52	nisstyre	this one is a steelseries
2015-04-05 17:09:57	+meskarune	oh nice
2015-04-05 17:10:00	alad	there's a few threads on mechanical keyboards, I use a Coolermaster quick storm (Brown) myself
2015-04-05 17:10:00	alad	http://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=36646
2015-04-05 17:10:39	fsckd	humans speak very fast. professional captioners use chording keyboards.
2015-04-05 17:11:30	nisstyre	is has nkro too
2015-04-05 17:11:34	nisstyre	nkro master race
2015-04-05 17:11:44	nisstyre	and it somehow does that with usb input too

2015-04-05 17:13:54	fsckd	alad: nice find, thanks
2015-04-05 17:18:15	alad	.. and I just realized I spelled my keyboard model wrong (*quickfire). the irony
2015-04-05 17:20:09	nisstyre	alad: I like the pinging sound some keys make when I release them too
2015-04-05 17:20:16	nisstyre	idk, it just sounds pleasing
2015-04-05 17:20:49	nisstyre	I also like that neither my laptop keyboard or mech one have a "windows" key
2015-04-05 17:21:16	+meskarune	I call that the super key
2015-04-05 17:22:25	alad	you can buy caps with a penguin logo and so on... the prices are extortionate though :P
2015-04-05 17:22:48	+meskarune	I have a keyboard that just has boxes on that key
2015-04-05 17:22:55	+meskarune	it looks very generic I guess
2015-04-05 17:24:12	nisstyre	alad: laptop has the ubuntu logo on that because it is a system76
2015-04-05 17:24:18	nisstyre	I prefer that over windows at least
2015-04-05 17:24:21	alad	boxes like http://img.carapedia.com/images/article/windows%208%20shortcut.jpeg ?
2015-04-05 17:24:59	alad	system76.. i've heard some things on those, how's the quality?
2015-04-05 17:25:14	fsckd	my desktop's keyboard has the manufacturer's logo: Microsoft /ducks
2015-04-05 17:25:50	nisstyre	alad: well the components are high quality, it has an i7 processor with the Iris Pro graphics, 8 gb of memory, 500 gb Samsun SSD, intel everything else
2015-04-05 17:25:59	nisstyre	*Samsung
2015-04-05 17:26:19	nisstyre	the screen is matte'd or w/e so it doesn't glare
2015-04-05 17:26:39	nisstyre	it's usually pretty cool too
2015-04-05 17:27:12	alad	I used to have a thinkpad x61 but it, eh, broke
2015-04-05 17:29:33	+meskarune	anything else meeting wise? :P
2015-04-05 17:29:46	+meskarune	have a sort of plan for meeting for mentoring
2015-04-05 17:29:51	+meskarune	3rd week of april
2015-04-05 17:29:57	+meskarune	and some ideas for video class

18:17:05 - alad: GermainZ: don't forget to add your name by clicking on the "people" button right :)
18:17:10 - alad: *on the right
18:17:43 - tigrmesh: we have a twitter message:  https://archwomen.org/wiki/meetings:2015_october
18:17:44 - phrik: Title: 41st IRC Meeting [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
18:17:59 - tigrmesh: oops.  not that  https://twitter.com/archwomen/status/650703677724991488
18:17:59 - polyzen: pastefail, tigrmesh
18:17:59 - phrik: Title: archwomen auf Twitter: "We have been having problems with awful spam today. If you can't speak, type `/query tigrmesh I can't speak`, and someone will help you :)" (at twitter.com)
18:18:11 - meskarune: I have crazy lag y'all T_T
18:18:38 - polyzen: the spammers have targetted meskarune
18:18:42 - alad: meskarune: tried a /reconnect ?
18:18:50 - sudokode: :(
18:18:58 - meskarune: I think its just my ISP lol
18:19:00 - tigrmesh: i started to write `awful spam problems`, but it's also been awful spam
18:19:22 - polyzen: tigrmesh, at least colorize_nicks.pl makes it pretty
18:19:38 - tigrmesh: hehe
18:19:39 - polyzen: when you enable in-line nick coloring :p
18:20:01 - sudokode: polyzen: colorize_lines too :P
18:20:13 - polyzen: that was too much for me lol
18:20:22 - GermainZ: look at my pretty glorious weechat https://ptpb.pw/ALRXz0k_0AiJ3Z9UxdRzgM2YYlsL.png
18:20:23 - sudokode: I hate going back now D:
18:20:37 - sudokode: that is very pretty
18:20:41 - polyzen: hm
18:21:01 - sudokode: https://ptpb.pw/xdaZ.png
18:21:09 - polyzen: GermainZ, are you going to start? :p
18:21:16 - GermainZ: should I? I'm confused :D
18:21:22 - GermainZ: I thought tigr did
18:21:46 * alad breaks the impasse
18:21:53 - alad: let's start! :P
18:21:56 * sudokode interrupts
18:22:13 - alad: so, 1. topic - the installation day on the 26th last month
18:22:14 - sudokode: just unplug me. I'm a broken printer
18:22:20 - alad: Since I wasn't there, how did it go?
18:23:26 - meskarune: it was awesome :D
18:23:31 * alad sends sudokode for repair to the Apple store
18:23:35 - meskarune: a few new people stopped by and said hi
18:23:45 - meskarune: but also pretty low key
18:24:00 - alad: cool. no problems with the beginner's guide or other wiki articles?
18:25:21 - tigrmesh: i don't think anyone actually installed except me working on mine.  we need to get the word out better
18:25:27 - polyzen: what can we do to better advertise it?
18:25:35 - polyzen: ^
18:25:41 - meskarune: social media
18:25:47 - meskarune: and forum posts
18:25:49 - meskarune: and mailing list
18:26:08 - polyzen: perhaps a note in the install and/or beginner guide?
18:26:22 - polyzen: was it mentioned in #archlinux-newbie?
18:26:26 - meskarune: oh good idea
18:26:27 - polyzen: the topic or anything
18:26:39 - tigrmesh: there was something on twitter.  but maybe something a 2 weeks before, 1 week before, and that day
18:26:41 - alad: polyzen: what did you have in mind as a note?
18:26:41 - GermainZ: maybe something on reddit too?
18:26:47 - alad: polyzen: for the guides that is
18:26:49 - tigrmesh: i think there was something in -newbie
18:26:52 - meskarune: ++
18:26:56 - polyzen: the link could be like "check here to find the next install day"
18:27:24 - tigrmesh: reddit?  really?  
18:27:35 - GermainZ: tigrmesh: why not?
18:27:35 - alad: polyzen: how about adding a link here https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Getting_and_installing_Arch
18:27:37 - phrik: Title: Category:Getting and installing Arch - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
18:27:42 - alad: GermainZ: reddit is ew
18:27:49 - alad: GermainZ: to put it mildly
18:27:53 - polyzen: alad, didn't know this page existed :p
18:27:55 - GermainZ: alad: depends on the sub, i'm not suggesting to post in /r/worldnews
18:28:04 - tigrmesh: on that day or immediately before?  sure
18:28:16 - alad: polyzen: well, it's a recent development - but it's now linked from both installation guides
18:28:24 - tigrmesh: oh
18:28:30 - polyzen: reddit could be a good way to get the word out, but perhaps could draw the wrnog crowd
18:28:36 - polyzen: alad, i see
18:28:52 - polyzen: tbf i don't really use reddit so might be biased
18:28:55 - GermainZ: polyzen: might be best to target female friendly subs then
18:29:07 - polyzen: sounds good
18:29:26 - meskarune: yeah, that's a great idea
18:30:44 - GermainZ: what about the arch general ML?
18:31:03 - MarkDude: Quotes from other projects regarding the awesomeness of Arch Docs help give Arch context. I mean the biggest suppoerts can be other Distros that like Docs from A
18:31:20 - polyzen: !g archlinux mailing lsits
18:31:21 - phrik: polyzen: lists.archlinux.org Mailing Lists: <https://www.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo>;
18:32:48 - GermainZ: potential subs: /r/archlinux, /r/girlsgonewired, /r/CSwomen, /r/TwoXChromosomes
18:33:13 - GermainZ: (the thread will need to explain what archlinux-women is, ofc)
18:33:33 - tigrmesh: there are others.  girls who code, maybe?
18:33:45 - meskarune: I love girlsgonewired :3
18:34:00 - tigrmesh: why these?  /r/CSwomen, /r/TwoXChromosomes
18:34:02 - polyzen: lol
18:34:20 - GermainZ: tigrmesh: women in CS are likely to be interested, no?
18:34:31 - GermainZ: tigrmesh: and TwoXChromosomes might be interested in projects that encourage women to get into tech
18:34:35 - Mikaela: the second seems a little transphobic to me knowing only the name
18:34:38 - tigrmesh: ohh.  i was thinking of cis-gendered
18:34:44 - polyzen: same :p
18:34:44 - GermainZ: CS is Computer Science
18:35:17 - tigrmesh: right.  and i think i read the list starting with the last one
18:35:18 - GermainZ: Mikaela: not a problem, other subs can be targeted as well if you know any for trans women
18:35:53 - Mikaela: GermainZ: I think proper target would be women, not trans or cis women separately.
18:36:13 - GermainZ: Mikaela: that can be done by targeting both separately if no one sub exists for both, don't you agree?
18:36:17 - krosos: I have a hard time reading back and following at the same time, but I think I can reach out to a friend in northern germany who might have ideas on how to promote this
18:36:31 - krosos: (in context of trans/non-binary etc)
18:36:36 - krosos: hackerspaces.. etc
18:36:49 - Mikaela: GermainZ: I am not active reddit user and have no idea of what exists and what doesn't
18:37:02 - krosos: it's in general about PR of the AW project or about installation day?
18:37:17 - GermainZ: Mikaela: well, that's what I know exists (after a search), hence my suggestions :)
18:38:24 - alad: krosos: whynotboth.gif
18:39:48 - krosos: sure. okay, I will see that I talk to them and there's some contact to the asta of the women department/thing in a university a friend is currently doing her master at, they might be interested too
18:40:03 - krosos: since they already offer install days once a month
18:40:14 * krosos makes notes
18:40:27 - alad: krosos: neat, thanks :)
18:40:43 - krosos: feel free to add this at the pad, i'm not on the pad
18:40:57 - polyzen: krosos, oooo
18:41:06 - polyzen: a collaboration would be cool
18:41:24 - krosos: um, i will add it to the pad myself, some more minutes and i can access it
18:41:26 - polyzen: krosos, want a link to the pad? or should i just add it?
18:41:57 - krosos: polyzen: no i can still see it, I have to open it from another computer
18:42:11 - polyzen: k
18:44:53 - krosos: added
18:45:44 - polyzen: ..no wonder this shirt felt so awkward.. i had it on backwards >.<
18:45:57 - alad: !grab polyzen
18:45:57 - phrik: alad: Tada!
18:46:04 - krosos: ohmy
18:47:12 - alad: sooo - next topic?
18:47:23 - alad: It says the dokuwiki was updated
18:47:25 - polyzen: onward to victory
18:48:04 - polyzen: fsckd, tigrmesh, meskarune ^ you probably know what this means
18:48:16 - polyzen: not sure if it's just a version bump or something special
18:48:39 - alad: I guess security and stuff
18:49:10 - polyzen: !gh archwomen webserver
18:49:11 - phrik: polyzen: archwomen/webserver · GitHub: <https://github.com/archwomen/webserver>;
18:49:30 - polyzen: nothing there
18:49:36 - tigrmesh: i do not remember.  but i think it's more a general statement about activity
18:49:49 - alad: upstream activity you mean?
18:50:30 - tigrmesh: no. just a 'we did stuff, and this was what it was'
18:50:54 - alad: ok :P
18:51:02 - polyzen: alrighty then
18:51:14 - tuxampol [~Mylin@ppp-188-174-39-2.dynamic.mnet-online.de] is de ruimte binnengekomen.
18:51:23 - tigrmesh: anything in -Syu that would be of particular interest or that involves web specific software - other than php  ;)
18:51:46 - meskarune: yeah, the dokuwiki software was updated to the latest version
18:51:48 - meskarune: :D
18:52:08 - acgtyrant heeft de ruimte verlaten (Quit: 堕入 /dev/null).
18:52:13 - alad: Should I add to the pad the server runs on Arch, or is this too obvious :P
18:52:27 - meskarune: lol
18:54:22 - alad: ok, moving on
18:54:37 - polyzen: nothing too special in the latest release aside from the hotfix
18:54:52 - alad: in the last meeting we discussed the group permissions e.a for the AQ wiki
18:54:55 - alad: *AW
18:55:12 - polyzen: "krosos> since they already offer install days once a month"
18:55:31 - polyzen: woops. " fix for issue 1296 with Extension Manager which prevented installing tarballs and"
18:55:53 - alad: polyzen: so security update?
18:55:58 - fsckd: is anyone doing anything on the wiki right now?
18:55:59 - polyzen: nope
18:56:08 - alad: fsckd: umm
18:56:10 - fsckd: i'm about to do something
18:56:12 - krosos: polyzen: to be specific, install days for debian (i think), but the information about AW could be interesting for mary (the person running it) too, if she doesn't know already :)
18:56:21 - polyzen: krosos, that was a pastefail
18:56:26 - krosos: oh :D
18:56:41 - polyzen: ah, so people who want arch could come here, then
18:56:56 - alad: we could link them the "Arch vs. other distributions"
18:57:16 - alad: It's a decent overview on what Arch does differently, without making overly bold claims
18:57:23 - alad: !aw Arch compared to other distributions
18:57:24 - phrik: alad: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_compared_to_other_distributions
18:59:19 - krosos: not on topic, but in the long run I am looking to try some installation wrokshop/whatever thing in safe spaces, maybe try it out in an lgbti* youth project friends run, so that's where I would try and get some (general) information on AW related projects into it.
18:59:38 - alad: +1
19:00:45 - alad: krosos: the Arch Linux page was also revised recently, and reflects the distribution pretty well
19:00:47 - alad: !aw Arch Linux
19:00:49 - phrik: alad: https://wiki.archlinux.org/
19:00:49 - polyzen: krosos, can you condense that into the notepad? :p
19:00:49 - krosos: long run/long shot. something
19:00:52 - meskarune: ok so the mentorship group was made and there is a public and group only pages
19:01:02 - alad: phrik: you
19:01:02 - phrik: alad: NO, YOU
19:01:05 - polyzen: krosos, long run
19:01:06 - meskarune: so people's contact infos are on private pages
19:01:12 - alad: krosos: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux
19:01:13 - phrik: Title: Arch Linux - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
19:01:27 - krosos: polyzen: no, because it's way down the road because of details I don't want in the meetings log :)
19:01:35 - alad: !give meskarune beer
19:01:36 - phrik: meskarune: http://pic.53280.de/factoids/beer.jpg
19:01:38 - polyzen: gotcha
19:02:09 - meskarune: :D
19:02:27 - polyzen: holy cow, alad
19:02:35 - polyzen: gj https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Arch_Linux&action=history
19:02:36 - phrik: Title: Revision history of "Arch Linux" - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
19:03:06 - halosghost: did I miss it?
19:03:23 - fsckd: halosghost: you missed everything. now the world shall end.
19:03:25 - alad: polyzen: thanks - most of the credit goes to thestinger ;)
19:03:30 - halosghost: D:
19:03:36 - alad: what fsckd said!
19:03:36 - fsckd: halosghost: the meeting though is still on :)
19:03:43 - halosghost: :D
19:03:47 - GermainZ: halosghost: teach us!
19:04:04 - polyzen: halosghost, you're up next. just in time :p
19:04:07 - Aster: m-m-mmeeting? :o
19:04:13 - halosghost: so, here's the tl;dr: my supervisor at work just gave notice to the CEO, so my responsibilities/work are skyrocketing
19:04:30 - alad: halosghost: not sure if :D or D:
19:04:32 - halosghost: and, at least, for the next week or so, I'm really not sure at all what I'm going to be having for free time
19:04:36 - halosghost: alad: it's plenty of both
19:04:40 - alad: heh
19:04:45 - Aster: halosghost: I have cake for free time, it's the best
19:04:57 - GermainZ: halosghost: is that a good thing for you or not (other than free time)?
19:04:57 - halosghost: as a result, I have had no time to write anything out for the syllabus
19:05:07 * Aster gives halosghost cake for their free time
19:05:10 - halosghost: GermainZ: 12:04:52     halosghost | alad: it's plenty of both
19:05:12 - halosghost: Aster: ❤
19:05:20 - meskarune: morning halosghost 
19:05:30 - GermainZ: halosghost: \o/ I guess
19:05:39 - polyzen: so should we move to halosghost's topic then jump back to the wiki in a bit? :p
19:05:55 - halosghost: oh
19:05:57 - halosghost: sorry
19:06:03 - halosghost: I thought you meant it was my turn to go when you said that
19:06:06 * halosghost waits
19:06:10 - polyzen: yeah, my mistake
19:06:12 - meskarune: halosghost: its ok, its not like we're paying you :P
19:06:24 - meskarune: fun is the most important thing
19:06:39 - halosghost: heh
19:06:50 - Aster: money is only the second most important thing!
19:06:51 - polyzen: halosghost, also congrats :)
19:07:08 - meskarune: ++
19:07:10 - halosghost: well, to wrap up what I have to say, rest assured: I still have every intention of getting a (basic) syllabus written for the course, at which point I'll be wanting to talk it over with jy2wong and whoever else may be interested in helping and then we can hammer out a real schedule
19:07:41 - polyzen: vunderba
19:07:46 - halosghost: I'm really shooting to have the basic one done before next meeting and having surveyed for help before the next meeting so that next meeting we'll be able to talk about schedule
19:07:50 - tuxampol heeft de ruimte verlaten (Quit: Verlassend).
19:09:23 - fsckd: halosghost: sounds good :)
19:09:37 - halosghost: and sorry for being late to the party!
19:09:38 - fsckd: halosghost: thank you :)
19:09:48 - fsckd: halosghost: no worries ^_^
19:10:09 - polyzen: you brought the party
19:10:09 - fsckd: i am half afk myself :)
19:10:44 - GermainZ: you killed the party
19:10:57 - polyzen: you bastard!
19:11:01 - GermainZ: :D
19:11:16 - alad: !yt video killed the radio star
19:11:17 - phrik: alad: Buggles - Video killed the radio star 1979 - YouTube: <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iwuy4hHO3YQ>;
19:11:23 - polyzen: meskarune, did you want to talk about mentors and organizers?
19:12:28 - meskarune: sure
19:12:52 - meskarune: lol
19:13:08 - meskarune: so right now we'll have a public contact person for mentorship program
19:13:23 - meskarune: and a private contact list of people who are trustworthy and want to mentor others
19:13:41 - meskarune: and then people who want a mentor can contact us
19:13:57 - meskarune: I was thinking of somehting like https://community.apache.org/mentoringprogramme.html
19:13:58 - phrik: Title: Apache Community Development - MentoringProgramme (at community.apache.org)
19:14:07 - meskarune: they have an application thingy with questions
19:14:27 - alad: ok, so tl;dr - if you wanted to be a mentor, you'd send a query or some such, and there'd be sanity checks, and then you'd be added to the list?
19:14:28 - meskarune: and these people http://teachingopensource.org/index.php/FOSS_Mentor_Projects#Outreach have a nice wiki page that they use for their mentor stuff
19:14:44 - meskarune: alad: yeah, basically
19:14:51 - meskarune: so we don't get trolls or whatever
19:15:03 - meskarune: and we protect the mentor's privacy from people with a go between
19:15:10 - meskarune: atm I'm the publicly available person
19:16:15 - polyzen: hm
19:16:56 - alad: and would these applications be always private, or can it be done in the channel or such, too ?
19:17:21 - meskarune: sure, if people wanna talk with me
19:17:28 - meskarune: or send an email or whateves
19:17:51 - alad: meskarune: well, in that case I'd volounteer on mentoring for anything archwiki related
19:18:14 - meskarune: ok :)
19:18:43 - meskarune: if you have a wiki account I can add you to mentor gropu and then you can add yourself to the list along with what you know
19:19:00 - MarkDude: Me too. Private or public- whichever helps. I'm decent at being a lightning rod- and that can help others not have as much drama
19:19:20 - MarkDude: (F*ck the trolls, they can talk direct to me.)
19:19:41 - meskarune: its not just trolling but doxing that is an issue
19:19:43 - MarkDude: If AW would like. Whatever would be helpful
19:19:43 - alad: meskarune: let me check if I didn't forge to fix my wiki account
19:19:44 - meskarune: and stalking
19:19:48 - alad: *forget
19:19:50 - meskarune: hehe
19:20:03 - MarkDude: Yep, my address is public, Im male, I can do this ally part well
19:20:46 - MarkDude: Again, this (Italian) posture is ONLY if AW would like. Im here to help. And that means me listening :)
19:23:04 - meskarune: thanks
19:26:10 - alad: meskarune: ok, IIRC my account was "Alad", but it says "Looks like there was an error on sending the password mail. Please contact the admin!"
19:26:21 - alad: the mail should be my regular archlinux.info one ...
19:27:02 - meskarune: I can reset your pass to something random so you can login
19:27:02 - alad: (and yes, I'm terrible at managing my keepass, that's why I lose my passwords from time to time)
19:27:06 - alad: meskarune: ok
19:27:18 - meskarune: I can't actually see anyones passwords
19:27:21 - meskarune: just reset them
19:27:53 - polyzen: alad, syncthing ftfw
19:28:00 - alad: !aw syncthing
19:28:01 - phrik: alad: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Syncthing
19:28:01 - polyzen: syncthing-inotify
19:28:13 - alad: polyzen: I'll look into it, thanks
19:28:18 - polyzen: :)
19:32:43 - meskarune: ok where are we in the meeting?
19:32:45 - meskarune: lol
19:33:31 - alad: we were at the group permissions
19:33:52 - alad: so, this is the correct link, right: https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:mentorship:start
19:33:53 - phrik: Title: Mentorship Program [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
19:35:51 - meskarune: yeah, and I neeed people to help add description and program information to the start page :)
19:36:34 - meskarune: https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:mentorship:offers
19:36:35 - phrik: Title: Mentorship offers [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
19:36:37 - meskarune: that should be a private page
19:36:52 - alad: we could condense some info from the pages you linked, as well as the meeting notes
19:36:53 - MarkDude Mikaela MrElendig meskarune marienz
19:36:57 - alad: meskarune: ok, so I just add myself there?
19:37:03 - meskarune: yep :)
19:37:09 - alad: *nods*
19:38:15 - meskarune: so its not set in stone yet, but for now, this is how the program is setup, with people listed privately and then we'll have some public people who can be go-betweens
19:38:20 - fsckd: the wiki doesn't send emails (yet)
19:38:36 - meskarune: yeah, need to setup that sendmail thingy
19:38:37 - alad: silly question, what classifies as "Linux sysadmin" ? :P
19:38:49 - meskarune: idk, I've been paid cash money to do it :P
19:39:06 - alad: ah ok :P
19:39:34 - meskarune: but if you can setup and secure a server and do automation things it probably counts :P
19:39:42 - meskarune: and system monitoring
19:39:48 - polyzen: i would very like to learn how to setup e-mail in dokuwiki, myself
19:39:56 - polyzen: very much*
19:40:19 - alad: ok, I think I got it right after 3 tries
19:40:24 - meskarune: \o/
19:41:03 - polyzen: i'd also like to be a mentor. i think there is plenty i can pass along :p
19:41:38 - polyzen: just wasn't sure what it entailed
19:41:50 - alad: polyzen: will you be mentoring in matters of "wat" ?
19:41:52 - polyzen: this helped https://community.apache.org/mentoringprogramme.html
19:41:53 - phrik: Title: Apache Community Development - MentoringProgramme (at community.apache.org)
19:41:55 - alad: polyzen: heh just kidding. glad to hear :P
19:41:59 - polyzen: alad, hehe
19:42:02 - meskarune: polyzen: well, thats info we need to have someone add to the mentorship page ;)
19:42:25 - meskarune: but really you just help someone when they get stuck
19:42:47 - meskarune: so you don't have to teach them from the beginging, but if a person is learning to program and gets stuck you can help explain things
19:43:03 - polyzen: gotcha
19:43:40 - polyzen: You are here: You've reached the Arch Women Wiki » projects » Mentorship Program » Mentorship offers
19:43:42 - polyzen: Permission Denied Sorry, you don't have enough rights to continue.
19:43:50 - polyzen: properly secured
19:43:54 - alad: yep yep
19:46:12 - alad: there's one more topic on the list: [hellerbarde] - Make sure people know about us. (and wiki structuring)
19:46:21 - alad: but I think we discussed that at the beginning of the meeting already
19:46:34 - meskarune: they wanted to have a wiki cleanup day
19:46:34 - alad: or ?
19:46:36 - alad: oh
19:46:51 - meskarune: I would also sorta like to have a class on contributing to the wiki
19:46:59 - meskarune: so people are encouraged to do so
19:47:08 - meskarune: some new users are sorta shy about doing that
19:47:40 - fsckd: was hellerbarde talking about arch linux wiki, arch women wiki, or both?
19:47:47 - meskarune: both
19:47:50 - alad: A full class would be long enough to cover both
19:47:51 - fsckd: ok
19:47:54 - alad: I think
19:48:11 - meskarune: yeah, just show people how the wiki works and wiki syntax and talk pages and stuff
19:48:31 - fsckd: i want to see the how to help page finished. i thought i wrote notes on it but now i think i didn't.
19:48:36 - alad: meskarune: well, I could probably cover that with some help
19:48:39 - fsckd: (aw wiki)
19:48:43 - polyzen: has there been a wiki cleanup day? if it's the first, we should focus on arch women
19:48:52 - krosos: shouldn't there be an "introduction to the wiki" / "how to use the wiki" etc page(s)?
19:48:53 - polyzen: consequent ones can be just general
19:49:07 - alad: polyzen: for archwiki, every day is a wiki cleanup day :P
19:49:15 - polyzen: that too
19:49:28 - alad: polyzen: so, cleanup we do here should probably focus on the archwomen wiki
19:49:45 - alad: for starters, at least
19:49:56 - alad: krosos: well, there's a few of those
19:49:59 - alad: krosos: sec
19:50:26 - alad: krosos: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Category:Help
19:50:27 - phrik: Title: Category:Help - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
19:50:36 - alad: krosos: lotsof paperwork, mind you :P
19:50:48 - krosos: ah
19:51:39 - alad: krosos: also, it can't really cover the things you learn from experience, so a class could help to condense some of those ideas as well
19:52:13 - krosos: that's true
19:52:40 - krosos: learning by doing or people talking from experience is worth more than something written down
19:52:55 - alad: yep
19:54:34 - tigrmesh: what can we do to increase the visibility of arch women?  or will posting about the class, install day and maybe after the wiki cleanup will be enough?
19:55:08 - alad: tigrmesh: maybe talk to jasonwryan on a sticky post somewhere?
19:55:12 - alad: also fsckd: ^
19:55:17 - alad: (on BBS that is)
19:55:29 - polyzen: tigrmesh, get arch linux to endorse aw events more, as they cover all of arch linux
19:56:08 - alad: the archwiki has an Events category as well, but it's unused since 2012 or so
19:56:16 - alad: could add an article there
19:56:18 - alad: as well
19:56:19 - polyzen: install day isn't only for women. wiki cleanup day isn't just for the aw wiki. mentorship probably isn't only for women, either
19:56:43 - meskarune: alad: we can def find some help for you :)
19:56:47 - polyzen: either/afaik*
19:56:50 - alad: meskarune: :)
19:57:18 - MMukherjee [~Howaboutt@unaffiliated/powerkiller] is de ruimte binnengekomen.
19:57:24 - meskarune: yeah, lets do an aw wiki cleanup and mark pages that need more content written
19:57:32 - alad: polyzen: well, I did notice that when "cleanups" or larger topics to be handled are announced to the community at large, lots of changes do happen
19:57:33 - tigrmesh: the arch wiki cleanup maybe should happen at a different time/day than the arch-women one.  too confusing since the wikis have such similar names
19:57:39 - alad: yeah
19:57:44 - krosos: i would like to volunteer, but otoh I have a truckload of other things to do and solve :/
19:57:51 - meskarune: yeah, and we can get some of the wiki mods involved for the arch wiki
19:58:08 - meskarune: krosos: well, this is going to be in the future after some planning :)
19:58:15 - meskarune: and we can hold more than one
19:58:15 - polyzen: imo the cleanup day should cover both
19:58:30 - polyzen: just be specific to the wiki y ou'r referring to.. shouldn't be hard
19:58:45 - tigrmesh: polyzen, hellerbarde's idea is for the arch women blog to be added to arch planet.  which reminds me
19:58:49 - krosos: meskarune: i meant not for the wiki, in general, offer more help :)
19:58:54 - polyzen: i feel that would lead to the most attendees
19:58:56 - tigrmesh: we need someone to write blog posts!
19:59:10 - alad: tigrmesh: I used to have a blog, but it took me way too long to write things up
19:59:14 - polyzen: there's an aw blog? :p
19:59:20 - polyzen: oh, there is
19:59:32 - alad: polyzen: one thing we do have to keep in mind though, is that efforts should be well-directed, or we might end up with more "mess" than "clean-up" :P
19:59:32 - meskarune: lol
19:59:35 - polyzen: i wonder if it's no gmane
19:59:39 - polyzen: on*
19:59:49 - polyzen: alad, gotcha
20:00:06 - tigrmesh: alad, anything.  even just events of interest to women in tech.  class announcements.  wiki cleanup day!
20:00:17 - tigrmesh: alad, true!
20:00:55 - polyzen: tigrmesh, perhaps mainly use twitter, and when something deserves a write-up, whip out a blog post
20:01:31 - tigrmesh: sure.  but we didn't have one for a long, long time
20:01:37 - krosos: tigrmesh: what if we sort this into project/teams/hords like gentoo does with projects, so there's more people working on a small amount of related content/sections/tasks
20:02:02 - krosos: so there's a blog team, etc
20:02:06 - tigrmesh: sure
20:02:11 - tigrmesh: awesome
20:02:36 - krosos: just an idea, i have no idea how many people are actually active helping
20:03:40 - alad: added to the map
20:03:45 - polyzen: tigrmesh, it should work out fine as twitter is mainly used now, anyways
20:03:48 - alad: *pad
20:03:51 - polyzen: as far as i can tell
20:04:00 - polyzen: by AW
20:06:15 - krosos: alad: okay, so maybe teams can get overview pages where a public contact is listed where they can get contacted, etc. (i would add this myself, but it might be put into confusing words)
20:06:43 - tigrmesh: ok
20:07:08 - tigrmesh: krosos, you add it, i will fix  :)
20:07:17 - krosos: to get a picture of what I am refering to, take a look at https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:KDE , similar to that, in addition to that
20:07:20 - phrik: Title: Project:KDE - Gentoo Wiki (at wiki.gentoo.org)
20:07:31 - krosos: s/addition*//
20:08:32 - MarkDude: +1 on having clear ideas on major wiki shifts, otherwise you end up with layers of archive/archiveS :D
20:09:05 - alad: krosos: it may sound obvious, but we should also consider the scope of the task at hand when looking at the number of projects to create
20:09:30 - krosos: the wiki restructuring and related ideas might need an entire pad for itself
20:09:44 - krosos: so we can provide and discuss idea, layouts, etc
20:09:44 - alad: MarkDude: on archwiki, there's often 10 pages for the exact same topic. terrible
20:09:50 - alad: krosos: sounds good
20:10:56 - alad: Ok, are there other topics to discuss? :)
20:11:01 - krosos: there's about a month to go, so I think I will look at the AW wiki, projects, etc and have something wwith more substance until the next meeting
20:11:14 - alad: krosos: cool
20:11:57 - krosos: not that I have a complete overview of what's there, but at least to give some visual/tree/structure thingie (lack of word right now)
20:12:10 - alad: krosos: a mindmap :D
20:12:23 - krosos: suggestion
20:12:25 - krosos: that's the one
20:15:24 - alad: tigrmesh: is there anything else, or can the meeting be adjourned? :D
20:15:54 - tigrmesh: moment
20:16:23 - youngbaks [~youngbaks@41.204.187.12] is de ruimte binnengekomen.
20:16:30 - tigrmesh: krosos, is this just about the wiki cleanup, or in general?  Use teams/projects to distribute efforts
20:16:38 - krosos: in general
20:16:48 - krosos: wiki cleanup, blog, [etc]
20:17:34 - krosos: it might already exist in this way, if so it wasn't obvious to me as I have not looked incredibly much into the AW wiki
20:18:24 - meskarune: I think right now its sorta a free for all :P
20:18:31 - tigrmesh: krosos, like that?
20:18:44 - krosos: tigrmesh: changes at pad you mean?
20:18:45 - krosos: yes
20:18:54 - tigrmesh: ok and yest
20:19:03 - tigrmesh: alad, now ready, i think
20:19:30 - alad: tigrmesh: can I post that fancy equal sign header, or would you like the honor ? :P
20:19:32 - tigrmesh: also, please look at the riseup pad in case there's something we missed
20:19:37 - tigrmesh: https://pad.riseup.net/p/arch-women_meeting_Oct-2015
20:19:40 - phrik: Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
20:19:42 - tigrmesh: alad, go for it  :)
20:19:57 - alad: ====== meeting ends ======

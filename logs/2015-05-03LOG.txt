2015-05-03 12:17:00 <tigrmesh>	===========  Begin Arch Linux Women IRC Meeting, 3 May 2015  ===========
2015-05-03 12:17:21 <MrElendig>	Bring out your dead!
2015-05-03 12:17:25 <tigrmesh>	hehe
2015-05-03 12:17:32 <tigrmesh>	that's coming up
2015-05-03 12:17:35 <fsckd>	!grab MrElendig 
2015-05-03 12:17:35 <phrik>	fsckd: Tada!
2015-05-03 12:17:41 <tigrmesh>	so any server updates?
2015-05-03 12:17:52 <tigrmesh>	*updates about the server?
2015-05-03 12:17:59 <meskarune>	:D
2015-05-03 12:18:04 <fsckd>	meeting notes here: https://pad.riseup.net/p/arch-women-meeting_May_2015
2015-05-03 12:18:05 <phrik>	Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
2015-05-03 12:22:38 <tigrmesh>	no?
2015-05-03 12:22:42 <tigrmesh>	ok
2015-05-03 12:22:48 <halosghost>	lol
2015-05-03 12:23:40 <tigrmesh>	so we never had the small group meeting about mentorship, and we decided to move it to the mailing list
2015-05-03 12:24:36 <meskarune>	I need to post to that, but my mail client keeps crashing
2015-05-03 12:24:50 <meskarune>	too many mails T_T
2015-05-03 12:25:00 <tigrmesh>	would anyone object to moved it back to IRC and set a time now?
2015-05-03 12:25:05 <tigrmesh>	*if we
2015-05-03 12:25:20 <tigrmesh>	we could post on the mailing list when the meeting will be
2015-05-03 12:26:06 <tigrmesh>	i'm not much of an email person either.  this is where the bulk of arch women's activity happens.  at least so far
2015-05-03 12:26:49 <fsckd>	it's hard to schedule a meeting. ml allows people to reply whenever it is convenient to them.
2015-05-03 12:27:28 <tigrmesh>	true
2015-05-03 12:27:45 <meskarune>	yeah, we had a hard time finding a time everyone could meet up that wanted to meet
2015-05-03 12:27:51 <tigrmesh>	ok
2015-05-03 12:28:14 <fsckd>	the topics are large. i'm thinking two or three email threads.
2015-05-03 12:32:31 *	markuman (~markuman@gir.cloud.tilaa.com) has joined
2015-05-03 12:35:01 <tigrmesh>	the list has 18 non-digested subscribers and 2 digested.  cool
2015-05-03 12:35:29 <CalimeroTeknik>	if the ML has a public archive, a bot could post links to new e-mail in the IRC channel
2015-05-03 12:35:35 <tigrmesh>	fsckd, what would be one to start with
2015-05-03 12:35:37 <tigrmesh>	true
2015-05-03 12:36:33 <fsckd>	start what with?
2015-05-03 12:37:38 <tigrmesh>	my mind is blank, but i'd like to post something about it to the list
2015-05-03 12:38:18 <fsckd>	assuming you are talking about the mentorship emails, this was the agenda for the meeting, https://archwomen.org/~fsckd/arch-women-mentorship-meeting-March_2015.txt
2015-05-03 12:38:38 <fsckd>	that's a number of topics, some related.
2015-05-03 12:39:36 <fsckd>	each topic could get its own thread, but related ones can be grouped into the same thread.
2015-05-03 12:40:09 <fsckd>	CalimeroTeknik: that is a good idea. at the least post new threads.
2015-05-03 12:49:13 <meskarune>	maybe we can pimp out the mailing list a bit
2015-05-03 12:49:28 <vodik>	woah, i'm actually around
2015-05-03 12:49:41 <fsckd>	a wild vodik appears
2015-05-03 12:50:20 *	vodik combs unkempt hair to be presentable
2015-05-03 12:50:24 <meskarune>	;)
2015-05-03 12:50:38 <vodik>	carry on, talk amongst yourselves
2015-05-03 12:50:39 <meskarune>	I am a square
2015-05-03 12:56:26 <meskarune>	(around asquare) :P
2015-05-03 12:56:37 <meskarune>	anyways, should we talk about mentorship stuff or classes now?
2015-05-03 12:56:43 <meskarune>	halosghost, jy2wong are ya'll around?
2015-05-03 12:57:24 <halosghost>	pong
2015-05-03 12:58:04 <halosghost>	classy things?
2015-05-03 12:58:53 <tigrmesh>	i'm going to take fsckd's list and paste the whole thing into an email to get the discussion started
2015-05-03 12:59:38 <tigrmesh>	unless someone stops me in the next 10 minutes
2015-05-03 13:00:50 <tigrmesh>	i think we've covered mentorship since it's been moved to the mailing list.  meskarune did you want to add something now?
2015-05-03 13:03:47 <tigrmesh>	jy2wong can't be here to say more about her class
2015-05-03 13:04:26 *	tuxampol (~Mylin@ppp-188-174-8-87.dynamic.mnet-online.de) has joined
2015-05-03 13:05:14 <tigrmesh>	halosghost, is your class close to being ready?  we can make the title something like, "An imperfect introduction to static typing"
2015-05-03 13:05:37 <halosghost>	I think it is ready, yeah
2015-05-03 13:05:42 <tigrmesh>	\o/
2015-05-03 13:05:52 <halosghost>	but, now that I have a full-time jobby thing, I'm not sure when the best time to hold it would be
2015-05-03 13:06:09 <tigrmesh>	the time you're available
2015-05-03 13:06:12 <halosghost>	I suppose I still get off work fairly early, so 16/16.30 CST
2015-05-03 13:06:17 <halosghost>	on weekdays
2015-05-03 13:06:24 <halosghost>	but that won't work for many people, I imagine
2015-05-03 13:08:16 <halosghost>	well, I'll figure out a time and hopefully hold the first session in the next two weeks
2015-05-03 13:08:17 <halosghost>	does that sound good?
2015-05-03 13:09:22 <meskarune>	thats fine :)
2015-05-03 13:09:28 <meskarune>	whenever is good for you
2015-05-03 13:09:59 <tigrmesh>	what time is that UTC?
2015-05-03 13:09:59 <halosghost>	all right
2015-05-03 13:10:07 <halosghost>	good question
2015-05-03 13:10:32 <halosghost>	21/21.30 UTC
2015-05-03 13:10:37 <halosghost>	apparently
2015-05-03 13:10:40 <halosghost>	:P
2015-05-03 13:10:47 <tigrmesh>	ok
2015-05-03 13:11:04 <halosghost>	yeah, because CDT == UTC - 5
2015-05-03 13:12:56 <halosghost>	all right, then I'll go through the syllabus again and make sure I'm set to walk others through the basics
2015-05-03 13:12:58 <tigrmesh>	bottom line, a class has to be given at a good time for the presenter.  but i still need to ask this.  is there any way you can give it on a weekend day so it can be at a time someone in poland can attend?
2015-05-03 13:13:18 <halosghost>	it depends
2015-05-03 13:13:29 <halosghost>	I'm not free this weekend (moving), and next weekend might not be free
2015-05-03 13:13:52 <tigrmesh>	moving takes much longer than expected
2015-05-03 13:13:52 <halosghost>	if it's better to get it done when the largeest number of people can be there, then in three weeks, I might be able to
2015-05-03 13:14:00 <meskarune>	ok
2015-05-03 13:14:00 <halosghost>	tigrmesh: well, in this case, it won't really :)
2015-05-03 13:14:28 <halosghost>	also, is the notion that it'll be done in-IRC?
2015-05-03 13:14:53 <tigrmesh>	you might not be able to give it before that either, since preparing to move takes a lot of time as well
2015-05-03 13:15:07 <halosghost>	tigrmesh: in this case, not really
2015-05-03 13:15:24 <halosghost>	I have the whole month to move
2015-05-03 13:15:29 <halosghost>	just that this upcoming weekend, my parents will be here to help
2015-05-03 13:15:36 <tigrmesh>	ahh.  gotcha
2015-05-03 13:16:23 <tigrmesh>	ok
2015-05-03 13:16:41 <tigrmesh>	so when would be best *for you*?
2015-05-03 13:17:04 <halosghost>	¯\o/¯
2015-05-03 13:17:26 <halosghost>	like I said, weekdays after I get off work are simplest because I'm free and likely won't have any plans
2015-05-03 13:17:32 <tigrmesh>	ok
2015-05-03 13:17:43 <tigrmesh>	give a time. 
2015-05-03 13:18:06 <halosghost>	I already gave a time, do you mean a date?
2015-05-03 13:18:12 <tigrmesh>	yeah
2015-05-03 13:18:26 <halosghost>	hrm
2015-05-03 13:18:51 <halosghost>	14 May?
2015-05-03 13:19:10 <halosghost>	(the day after I finish a large-scale product launch at work, should mean I'm much more laid-back :P)
2015-05-03 13:20:23 <meskarune>	\o/
2015-05-03 13:21:10 <tigrmesh>	so shall we give the additional half hour and say 21:30 UTC?  
2015-05-03 13:21:36 <halosghost>	sure
2015-05-03 13:21:46 <halosghost>	but, I'm still unsure of what is the best way to hold the class
2015-05-03 13:21:55 <halosghost>	since I'll want to show code snippets and the like
2015-05-03 13:21:59 <tigrmesh>	so class will be 14 May 2015 at 21:30 UTC  <<<  class
2015-05-03 13:22:30 <tigrmesh>	did you have a particular technology in mind?
2015-05-03 13:23:00 <halosghost>	not really
2015-05-03 13:23:08 <halosghost>	we've talked about this before but never really settled on anything
2015-05-03 13:23:16 <tigrmesh>	right.
2015-05-03 13:23:20 <meskarune>	code snippets could go into a git repo or website
2015-05-03 13:23:25 <halosghost>	I mean, I can just leverage a pastebin
2015-05-03 13:23:27 <halosghost>	yeah
2015-05-03 13:23:53 <tigrmesh>	or a riseup pad
2015-05-03 13:24:44 <tigrmesh>	if you want to do it a different way than irc + pastebin or whatever, research and give us an update.
2015-05-03 13:25:06 <halosghost>	yeah
2015-05-03 13:25:08 <halosghost>	will do
2015-05-03 13:25:59 <tigrmesh>	i'd like to have this as concrete as possible.  we can set the specific time and to happen on irc.  and change the format/tech if you want
2015-05-03 13:26:25 <tigrmesh>	i'd prefer to not have finding the tech to hold up the class.
2015-05-03 13:26:33 <tigrmesh>	does that make sense?
2015-05-03 13:28:19 <halosghost>	definitely
2015-05-03 13:28:28 <halosghost>	call it IRC + ptpb snippets for now
2015-05-03 13:28:49 <halosghost>	should we need to change the tech, I'll ping you in here and we can discuss it
2015-05-03 13:29:09 <tigrmesh>	awesome
2015-05-03 13:32:04 <tigrmesh>	it's official
2015-05-03 13:32:29 <halosghost>	:D
2015-05-03 13:32:30 <tigrmesh>	class  >>  class will be held on 14 May 2015 at 21:30 UTC in #archlinux-classroom  <<  class
2015-05-03 13:32:47 <meskarune>	yay
2015-05-03 13:32:50 <tigrmesh>	there is a possilility of using a different format, an update will be given if so.  but the time and date are firm.
2015-05-03 13:32:56 <tigrmesh>	\o/
2015-05-03 13:33:35 <tigrmesh>	anything else anyone wants to bring up?  comments, questions?
2015-05-03 13:37:14 <tigrmesh>	i'm going to give it another couple of minutes
2015-05-03 13:37:29 <tigrmesh>	in case someone was getting more tea or whatever
2015-05-03 13:37:43 <halosghost>	meskarune mentioned she'd be interested in seeing another PKGBUILD or a git class
2015-05-03 13:37:46 <Aremis117>	idea, just out of the side of my head
2015-05-03 13:38:04 <meskarune>	\o/
2015-05-03 13:38:16 <Aremis117>	For the IRC channel, a minecraft server.  I dunno just kinda popped up.  Might be fun for some people
2015-05-03 13:38:32 <meskarune>	that does sound fun :)
2015-05-03 13:38:40 <tigrmesh>	hehe
2015-05-03 13:38:41 <Aremis117>	!shrug
2015-05-03 13:38:42 <phrik>	¯\(º_o)/¯
2015-05-03 13:39:13 <tigrmesh>	anyone want to give a pkguild class?  or git?
2015-05-03 13:39:34 <meskarune>	we could maybe throw minecraft onto the dataserver adn have a weekend event or something :)
2015-05-03 13:40:25 <halosghost>	kaictl did a PKGBUILD class once
2015-05-03 13:40:31 <halosghost>	I wonder if ey'd be up for a repeat
2015-05-03 13:40:50 <tigrmesh>	i know, right?  i've pinged him to ask
2015-05-03 13:40:51 <meskarune>	or demize ;)
2015-05-03 13:40:59 <meskarune>	new TU powars
2015-05-03 13:41:04 <tigrmesh>	right
2015-05-03 13:41:22 <meskarune>	really for PKGBUILD we have previous classes for people to go on :)
2015-05-03 13:41:48 <halosghost>	also, it might be a bit too mathy/out-there for a class here, but I've been tripping over the λ-calculus for a while now and I'm minorly in-love
2015-05-03 13:41:58 <halosghost>	if that's something people would be interested in, I'd consider writing one up

2015-05-03 13:42:12 <halosghost>	legit
2015-05-03 13:42:48 <tigrmesh>	please let halosghost know if a λ-calculus class is something you'd be interested in
2015-05-03 13:42:53 <meskarune>	arch classroom is classes for arch users :P
2015-05-03 13:42:58 <tigrmesh>	yeah
2015-05-03 13:43:02 <meskarune>	so whatever people wanna teach/learn
2015-05-03 13:43:28 <meskarune>	I think study groups for learning to program would be cool too, but we need more people involved
2015-05-03 13:43:41 <tigrmesh>	yeah
2015-05-03 13:46:17 <fsckd>	do it, lambda calculus class!

2015-05-03 13:48:11 <halosghost>	lol
2015-05-03 13:48:28 <halosghost>	Church Encoding, in particular, is fascinating to me
2015-05-03 13:48:32 <halosghost>	so, maybe that'll happen
2015-05-03 13:48:38 <halosghost>	after the whole static typing class though
2015-05-03 13:48:51 <fsckd>	yeah, certainly
2015-05-03 13:49:57 <fsckd>	here's something i'd like to add to the meeting agenda: https://archwomen.org/wiki/todo:classroom_license
2015-05-03 13:49:58 <phrik>	Title: Classroom License [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
2015-05-03 13:50:33 <fsckd>	should have handled it long ago but better late than never
2015-05-03 13:50:50 <tigrmesh>	right
2015-05-03 13:55:11 <tigrmesh>	*crickets chirp*
2015-05-03 13:56:18 <fsckd>	crickets are considered lucky
2015-05-03 13:56:40 <tigrmesh>	i know nothing about licenses.  and i haven't given a class.  halosghost, since you're presenting a class, have you given any thought to a license you'd want to use?
2015-05-03 13:57:11 <halosghost>	either ISC, GPL or the Open Documentation License
2015-05-03 13:57:33 <fsckd>	GPL? you mean GDL?
2015-05-03 13:58:03 <halosghost>	s/, GPL.*/or the GDL/
2015-05-03 13:58:19 <halosghost>	fsckd: thanks
2015-05-03 13:58:24 <fsckd>	ok :)
2015-05-03 13:58:40 <tigrmesh>	CalimeroTeknik, also taught a pkgbuild class.  perhaps he'd be interested in doing another
2015-05-03 13:59:03 <fsckd>	arch wiki uses GDL. if there were to be information exchange with the arch wiki, gdl would be the choice.

2015-05-03 14:11:48 <tigrmesh>	fsckd, do you want a decision now?
2015-05-03 14:13:42 <tigrmesh>	also, do you have links to docs for that?
2015-05-03 14:13:47 <tigrmesh>	*those?
2015-05-03 14:13:56 <fsckd>	docs?
2015-05-03 14:14:27 <tigrmesh>	like this  http://opensource.org/licenses/ISC

2015-05-03 14:15:20 <tigrmesh>	oh
2015-05-03 14:15:37 <fsckd>	ISC is a short license :)
2015-05-03 14:15:59 <tigrmesh>	which one is open documentation?
2015-05-03 14:16:53 <fsckd>	not in that list
2015-05-03 14:17:27 <halosghost>	tigrmesh: I meant the GDL really

2015-05-03 14:18:20 <halosghost>	yeah, that one
2015-05-03 14:18:55 *	polyzen (~poly@unaffiliated/polyzen) has joined
2015-05-03 14:19:31 <tigrmesh>	do you have a link to the open documentation license?
2015-05-03 14:20:33 <fsckd>	arch linux wiki has this at the bottom of every page: Content is available under GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 or later
2015-05-03 14:23:10 <halosghost>	tigrmesh: I meant the GDL (what you called the FDL)
2015-05-03 14:23:41 <tigrmesh>	halosghost, sorry about this.  but i have acronym overload really fast when it comes to license stuff.  so please confirm.  by "Open Documentation License" you meant GNU FDL the arch wiki license?
2015-05-03 14:23:52 <halosghost>	yes
2015-05-03 14:24:07 <fsckd>	i think something like this, (1) decide on license (2) get past teachers who have their stuff in classroom-media to license their stuff in classroom-media with that license (3) ??? (4) profit
2015-05-03 14:24:09 <tigrmesh>	\o/
2015-05-03 14:24:14 <fsckd>	g2g have fun
2015-05-03 14:24:51 <tigrmesh>	halosghost, how do you feel about this one?

2015-05-03 14:25:15 <halosghost>	CC BY-NC-SA is fine too
2015-05-03 14:33:47 <tigrmesh>	does the ISC have another name?  also, one downside is that ISC actually has the person's info in the license
2015-05-03 14:36:10 <tigrmesh>	fsckd, did you want a decision today?
2015-05-03 14:36:48 <meskarune>	I mostly use NC-SA but if Arch uses GDL thats probably good too
2015-05-03 14:41:15 <meskarune>	does anyone know why Arch peeps choose GDL over other licenses?
2015-05-03 14:41:31 <halosghost>	I mean, that's just for documentation
2015-05-03 14:41:32 <fsckd>	tigrmesh: sure, if possible.
2015-05-03 14:41:54 <halosghost>	and I bet it was mostly just because the ArchWiki chose it
2015-05-03 14:42:02 <tigrmesh>	um.  not sure how to proceed.  we can ask all former contributors, and the let the person who has the most interest in one gets to choose.  in case of no decision or a tie, the person who gets the highest score on 2048 gets to decide
2015-05-03 14:42:19 <halosghost>	lol
2015-05-03 14:42:37 <fsckd>	i have the lowest score :(
2015-05-03 14:42:54 <tigrmesh>	*and let the person who has the most interest in one particular license get
2015-05-03 14:43:14 <tigrmesh>	use the phone, luke
2015-05-03 14:43:36 <tigrmesh>	it's in the fdroid repo
2015-05-03 14:44:45 <tigrmesh>	load it on your phone, drive to miami (NYC will do as substitute), pull over to calm down, play.  your score will improve exponentially!
2015-05-03 14:46:01 <fsckd>	haha, 2048 bootcamp is in the parking lot in from of Walmart :P
2015-05-03 14:46:26 <meskarune>	we could play rock, paper scissors ;)
2015-05-03 14:46:39 <meskarune>	or just vote
2015-05-03 14:47:00 <tigrmesh>	so the 3 candidates are CC BY-NC-SA 3.0, GNU FDL and ISC.  i'd be willing to contact the past contributors and ask their preference. 
2015-05-03 14:47:03 *	kaipee has quit (Ping timeout: 250 seconds)
2015-05-03 14:47:17 <tigrmesh>	and i'd suggest if none of them has one, we use the same as the arch wiki
2015-05-03 14:48:36 <tigrmesh>	not suggest to them.  but as a guide in case there are no objections
2015-05-03 14:48:43 <tigrmesh>	anyone here object?
2015-05-03 14:48:54 <meskarune>	thats fine with me
2015-05-03 14:49:25 <tigrmesh>	of course, if there come to be other suggestions, i'd bring that info back
2015-05-03 14:49:28 <tigrmesh>	anyone?
2015-05-03 14:49:32 <tigrmesh>	*else?
2015-05-03 14:49:40 *	spider-mario has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2015-05-03 14:51:10 <tigrmesh>	it would be nice to wrap this up
2015-05-03 14:52:41 <tigrmesh>	one last thing.  if any of you might want to teach a class in the future, think about what license you'd want to use.  and let me know
2015-05-03 14:53:37 *	demize (kyrias@archlinux/op/demize) has joined
2015-05-03 14:55:38 <tigrmesh>	alright

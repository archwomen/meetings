2016-08-13 16:45:26	fsckd	hi ng0, meeting is just started. :)
2016-08-13 16:45:30	ng0	hi
2016-08-13 16:46:24	fsckd	So first of all, there was a git class. It went very well. Thanks to all who participated. :)
2016-08-13 16:48:03	fsckd	It was a workshop where students got hands on experience with basic git commands, like git add, git push, git pull, and so on. Logs are linked to from the classroom page on the Arch Linux wiki.

2016-08-13 16:49:23	phrik	Title: Index of /media/project_classroom/lessons/2016-07-16-git_for_gits/ (at archwomen.org)
2016-08-13 16:49:28	@meskarune	media for the class :)
2016-08-13 16:49:50	fsckd	direct link to logs: https://archwomen.org/media/project_classroom/classlogs/2016-07-16-git_for_gits.txt
2016-08-13 16:50:14	fsckd	those are also available in the classroom-media repo on Arch Women's GitHub.
2016-08-13 16:50:47	fsckd	Next announcement, the flask site is up. :)
2016-08-13 16:51:24	fsckd	Switching from PHP to flask (a python framework/library) for serving websites.
2016-08-13 16:51:45	@meskarune	eventually the blog will be switched to it too
2016-08-13 16:51:52	fsckd	awesome
2016-08-13 16:51:55	@meskarune	the new flask site uses markdown so its way easier for anyone to edit and add to
2016-08-13 16:52:07	@meskarune	it also has a nice mobile menu
2016-08-13 16:52:23	pid1	Is the blog work available at https://github.com/archwomen as well? I'd be happy to lend a hand.
2016-08-13 16:52:24	phrik	Title: Arch Linux Women Project · GitHub (at github.com)
2016-08-13 16:53:05	@meskarune	pid1: thanks! There is a repo flask-site but I need to update it with the latest code heh
2016-08-13 16:53:10	@meskarune	I should probably do that today
2016-08-13 16:53:32	pid1	Sounds good! Just shoot me a link.
2016-08-13 16:53:48	@meskarune	pid1: I was thinking of using frozen-flask
2016-08-13 16:54:24	@meskarune	to either generate a cache of html files or generate the blog since blog pages aren't going to be edited as often or have dynamic things
2016-08-13 16:54:39	pid1	That's a good plan, we might as well. 
2016-08-13 16:54:46	@meskarune	:D
2016-08-13 16:54:54	pid1	We don't have much (any?) dynamic content to work with anyway, so we might as well.
2016-08-13 16:55:33	 *	pid1 clearly needs more coffee.
2016-08-13 16:55:38	fsckd	hehe
2016-08-13 16:55:50	 *	halosghost gives pid1 a 20 oz of espresso
2016-08-13 16:56:39	fsckd	ok, so in short, the flask site is what is serving the main pages of the website now. so the issue with the front page being super slow is effectively fixed. :)
2016-08-13 16:57:23	pid1	woop woop
2016-08-13 16:57:30	@meskarune	and its moar better on mobile
2016-08-13 16:58:17	@meskarune	on my todo is an event list using ical
2016-08-13 16:58:25	@meskarune	or some other calendar type thingy
2016-08-13 16:58:35	@meskarune	and maybe twitter tweets but idk
2016-08-13 16:58:44	fsckd	cool
2016-08-13 16:59:29	fsckd	those are the announcements. anything else to be announced?
2016-08-13 17:00:31	fsckd	Ok, moving along...
2016-08-13 17:00:59	fsckd	Add Arch Code of Conduct to the community rules of Arch Women.
2016-08-13 17:01:21	@meskarune	our community standards are pretty short
2016-08-13 17:01:26	@meskarune	then we have rules for irc
2016-08-13 17:01:41	fsckd	code of conduct: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Code_of_conduct
2016-08-13 17:01:43	phrik	Title: Code of conduct - ArchWiki (at wiki.archlinux.org)
2016-08-13 17:01:45	@meskarune	https://archwomen.org/community-standards/
2016-08-13 17:01:46	phrik	Title: Arch Linux Women | community-standards (at archwomen.org)
2016-08-13 17:04:00	j605	it is short and to the point. Do you want legalese there?
2016-08-13 17:05:00	@meskarune	well I was sorta thinking to add a page on conflict resolution
2016-08-13 17:05:11	ng0	i currently can not open it, but what i found about coc's is that sometimes you need to go into details in external documents so that the coc doesn't leave space open for interpretations
2016-08-13 17:05:14	@meskarune	and possibly contact information for AW mods
2016-08-13 17:05:42	ng0	that's what i went for in guix, removing interpretationspace in the manual
2016-08-13 17:06:43	@meskarune	j605: most of our stuff is short and to the point actually :) I don't like weasel words and shit, but its possible that it doesn't cover enough
2016-08-13 17:06:49	@meskarune	¯\_(シ)_/¯
2016-08-13 17:06:54	pid1	i appreciate keeping things like "This is both not quantifiable and not negotiable. It is a judgment call and entirely at the discretion of the Op requesting your exit." in there
2016-08-13 17:07:18	pid1	it is the same thing we have in #archlinux et al, and it helps give the OPs sufficient discretion.
2016-08-13 17:07:37	halosghost	pid1: ++
2016-08-13 17:07:41	@meskarune	yeah, sometimes there are edge cases or whatever and you can't cover every damn thing lol
2016-08-13 17:07:45	pid1	exactly
2016-08-13 17:10:09	@meskarune	maybe we can just have a meeting on community standards at a later date to hash out a little and update them
2016-08-13 17:10:15	@meskarune	fsckd ?
2016-08-13 17:10:38	fsckd	OK
2016-08-13 17:10:48	fsckd	When?
2016-08-13 17:11:12	@meskarune	maybe tues evening? or would a weekend better?
2016-08-13 17:11:20	@meskarune	idk who all wants to get in on it
2016-08-13 17:11:42	@meskarune	I have a lot of ideas but I need some people to argue with me and edit :)
2016-08-13 17:11:53	fsckd	Or do it on the ml?
2016-08-13 17:11:56	halosghost	I would definitely be up for that
2016-08-13 17:12:22	@meskarune	fsckd: we can do both, have a mailing list thread to start and then meeting for people to get soemthing done real time
2016-08-13 17:12:39	@meskarune	I want to get it written and posted
2016-08-13 17:13:02	fsckd	sound good
2016-08-13 17:14:14	@meskarune	is tues evening too soon?
2016-08-13 17:14:40	fsckd	i'm fine with Tues. evening. i defer to everyone else.
2016-08-13 17:16:04	fsckd	meskarune: what time in the evening?
2016-08-13 17:16:45	fsckd	Tuesday, August 16th
2016-08-13 17:17:46	@meskarune	6-8
2016-08-13 17:17:51	@meskarune	around there somewhere
2016-08-13 17:18:26	-->	tuxampol (~Mylin@aftr-185-17-207-246.dynamic.mnet-online.de) has joined #archlinux-women
2016-08-13 17:18:52	fsckd	that's 22:00 UTC
2016-08-13 17:19:56	@meskarune	halosghost, pid1, everyone else?
2016-08-13 17:20:41	halosghost	22.00 UTC
2016-08-13 17:20:53	 *	halosghost tries to convert that to CDT
2016-08-13 17:21:11	fsckd	halosghost: date -d '22:00 UTC'
2016-08-13 17:21:28	halosghost	wow
2016-08-13 17:21:43	halosghost	that's one of the more amazing cli things I've seen recently
2016-08-13 17:21:49	halosghost	fsckd: you are a wizard
2016-08-13 17:21:59	halosghost	also, 5 is hopefully doable
2016-08-13 17:22:05	halosghost	I'll try to be home from work by then
2016-08-13 17:22:15	halosghost	s/5/17/
2016-08-13 17:22:15	fsckd	date command makes converting to and from UTC very easy.
2016-08-13 17:22:51	fsckd	-d option is where the real power of date command is. ^_^
2016-08-13 17:23:00	halosghost	:D
2016-08-13 17:23:11	 *	libbies routinely uses date -d to convert unix time to time, because of log files
2016-08-13 17:23:26	ng0	it gets easier when your timezone is utc and you just have to convert
2016-08-13 17:24:34	@meskarune	I set my computer time to utc heh
2016-08-13 17:24:40	@meskarune	and then my user is EST
2016-08-13 17:25:04	@meskarune	but I am the only person I know who does that
2016-08-13 17:25:05	fsckd	i should do that. >_>
2016-08-13 17:25:50	j605	How do you do that
2016-08-13 17:26:22	ng0	i convert local times in my head, keep everything else in utc. makes international time convertions easier.
2016-08-13 17:26:37	ng0	TZ="UTC"
2016-08-13 17:27:05	@meskarune	export TZ="/usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York"
2016-08-13 17:27:23	@meskarune	you can put into .Xprofile and .profile
2016-08-13 17:27:29	@meskarune	or .zshenv or whatever
2016-08-13 17:27:37	@meskarune	j605: ^
2016-08-13 17:27:59	@meskarune	then it only affects your user session
2016-08-13 17:28:05	ng0	to be correct in my cases: (operating-system (timezone "UTC"))
2016-08-13 17:28:23	ng0	was there anything left fot the meeting?
2016-08-13 17:28:41	@meskarune	fsckd: ok, I guess we'll set that as a meeting :D
2016-08-13 17:29:27	@meskarune	did we have any other community stuff?
2016-08-13 17:29:30	j605	meskarune: thanks :)
2016-08-13 17:29:42	fsckd	no more community stuff. next is classroom.
2016-08-13 17:31:24	ng0	on classroom, i currently feel a lack of energy and time to even prepare one. i thought i mention as I said something along these lines expressing interest before.
2016-08-13 17:31:41	ng0	too much action elsewhere
2016-08-13 17:31:57	fsckd	ng0: no worries, thanks for letting us know. :)
2016-08-13 17:32:19	fsckd	real life and higher priority things take precedence. :)
2016-08-13 17:35:29	fsckd	For the license of class materials, CC BY-NC-SA will be the license for future classes.
2016-08-13 17:36:13	fsckd	(past classes will depend on various things and will be decided on a case by case basis)
2016-08-13 17:36:27	fsckd	having a single license for all classes simplifies things
2016-08-13 17:37:02	fsckd	also, ArchWiki interop is a no go. the trend on the wiki now is to direct users to upstream docs.
2016-08-13 17:37:30	fsckd	so hosting tutorials or anything is not something they will do.
2016-08-13 17:38:44	@meskarune	which is fine, we can link to docs when we need and have class notes and materials in git repos
2016-08-13 17:38:57	fsckd	yup
2016-08-13 17:44:14	@meskarune	so then teaching more classes is up next in the agenda I think
2016-08-13 17:44:19	fsckd	there will be some more changes to classroom in the future. will be hashing that out. more info. in the Sept. meeting i think.
2016-08-13 17:44:50	@meskarune	oh, like with the github and stuff?
2016-08-13 17:44:55	fsckd	yeah
2016-08-13 17:45:00	@meskarune	kk
2016-08-13 17:45:20	fsckd	also need to update my classroom futures page on arch wiki :)
2016-08-13 17:45:54	fsckd	Ok, so would like volunteers for a bash class or another PKGBUILD class, if anyone is interested. :)
2016-08-13 17:46:23	halosghost	I'd be willing to help out with a PKGBUILD class
2016-08-13 17:49:36	@meskarune	I can help with PKGBUILD class
2016-08-13 17:49:46	@meskarune	and there are previous class notes that can be used again
2016-08-13 17:49:52	@meskarune	so it shouldn't be hard to throw together
2016-08-13 17:50:02	fsckd	yeah :)
2016-08-13 17:50:19	@meskarune	I was also emailed by someoen who wants to teach a prompt customization class
2016-08-13 17:50:40	@meskarune	They told me they would work on a sylabus this weekend and email
2016-08-13 17:50:43	@meskarune	email me
2016-08-13 17:51:58	fsckd	sweet
2016-08-13 17:54:48	fsckd	if anyone wants to teach a bash or PKGBUILD class, please contact us in here or on the arch women mailing list. thanks. :)
2016-08-13 17:55:24	fsckd	Next on the agenda is mentorship.
2016-08-13 17:55:54	fsckd	Would like more volunteers to be mentors.
2016-08-13 17:56:28	halosghost	I would also be willing to do that
2016-08-13 17:56:41	fsckd	Mentor info. is not made public.
2016-08-13 17:56:42	halosghost	but given that this is -women, it should probably be made clear that I do not identify as a woman
2016-08-13 17:57:11	fsckd	halosghost: cool
2016-08-13 17:58:10	@meskarune	yeah, I will ask people if they have a gender preference or preference for someone who is LGBTQA
2016-08-13 17:58:16	@meskarune	I think some people might have preferences like that
2016-08-13 17:58:40	@meskarune	I'm sure people would be interested in just general getting started with linux help as well as programming
2016-08-13 17:59:21	fsckd	that ties into the need for making a form for prospective mentees.
2016-08-13 17:59:22	pid1	I'd be happy to mentor RE systems administration, networking, and automation stuff (Puppet et al)
2016-08-13 17:59:59	pid1	same concerns as halosghost though RE if someone would prefer a similar background/experiences
2016-08-13 18:00:00	@meskarune	thanks :)
2016-08-13 18:00:38	@meskarune	the mentoring stuff is specifically to help disadvantaged groups contribute to arch and learn
2016-08-13 18:01:03	@meskarune	sometimes they can't just post in channel asking for help, they might not be comfortable
2016-08-13 18:01:51	@meskarune	or know if the person who helps them is gonna be ok if they find out their mentee is female or disabled or LGBTQA or whatever else
2016-08-13 18:02:24	-->	swift110 (~swift1104@64.26.99.248) has joined #archlinux-women
2016-08-13 18:02:34	@meskarune	so I want to address that specific thing
2016-08-13 18:02:44	fsckd	i should reiterate, mentor identities are not public. we try to screen prospective mentees.
2016-08-13 18:02:54	@meskarune	if arch linux in general is interested in a mentor thing though I would be willing to help with that
2016-08-13 18:03:11	@meskarune	fsckd: yeah, I mean, I'd screen mentors too :P
2016-08-13 18:03:23	fsckd	haha
2016-08-13 18:03:26	@meskarune	in case someone thinks they can use it like a dating service >.>
2016-08-13 18:03:37	fsckd	:/
2016-08-13 18:03:38	@meskarune	there are some weird assholes and I wouldn't just add someone I didn't know to the list
2016-08-13 18:03:47	fsckd	yeah, totally
2016-08-13 18:04:11	fsckd	should there also be a mentor sign up form?
2016-08-13 18:04:14	@meskarune	I'm willing to be a public contact
2016-08-13 18:04:21	@meskarune	fsckd: yeah I think so
2016-08-13 18:04:30	@meskarune	but for now I'm fine adding pid1 and halosghost
2016-08-13 18:04:40	@meskarune	since they aren't strangers lol
2016-08-13 18:05:13	 *	fsckd casts a suspicious eye on pid1 and halosghost :P
2016-08-13 18:05:38	halosghost	topics I'd like to mentor on: C, Pandas, banning everyone
2016-08-13 18:05:41	halosghost	:P
2016-08-13 18:05:43	@meskarune	haha
2016-08-13 18:05:55	pid1	i can vouch for 2 and 3 there
2016-08-13 18:05:57	pid1	especially 3
2016-08-13 18:06:15	fsckd	i think for the forms we should have that discussion on the ml. i'll draft two emails to post.
2016-08-13 18:06:21	fsckd	lol!
2016-08-13 18:08:20	ng0	i want a classrom on Pandas which are banning everyone for using C
2016-08-13 18:08:36	halosghost	ng0: done
2016-08-13 18:08:47	halosghost	ng0: I already have the syllabus finished
2016-08-13 18:09:02	halosghost	it's titled, “Inside the Life and Times of halosghost”
2016-08-13 18:09:10	fsckd	lmao
2016-08-13 18:09:29	pid1	 i like "Halosghost: A Paenda Story"
2016-08-13 18:09:53	halosghost	pid1: ooh, solid
2016-08-13 18:10:33	fsckd	The Life Pandatic with Halosghost
2016-08-13 18:11:15	pid1	"A Life Paentasitc"
2016-08-13 18:11:27	fsckd	heh
2016-08-13 18:12:04	fsckd	i'm using that now, "This spaghetti is pandastic!"
2016-08-13 18:12:53	pid1	should i use something like numpy for the test-sec-flags math, or would just sed and bc be sufficient?
2016-08-13 18:13:17	@meskarune	haha
2016-08-13 18:13:25	fsckd	The last agenda item: Setup email group for mentor program - mentorship@archwomen.org, maybe have a mailing list thread?
2016-08-13 18:13:43	@meskarune	pid1: sed and bc are more commonly installed by people :)
2016-08-13 18:13:59	pid1	oh this is just for our needs, to put together something for the ML
2016-08-13 18:14:04	j605	who installs bc?
2016-08-13 18:14:05	@meskarune	fsckd: we have a group for admin@archwomen.org
2016-08-13 18:14:05	pid1	so i'm less concerned about portability etc
2016-08-13 18:14:12	pid1	j605: i do :(
2016-08-13 18:14:12	@meskarune	and webmaster I think and abuse@
2016-08-13 18:14:16	pid1	my go-to calculator, actually
2016-08-13 18:14:42	j605	pid1: even I have it, but for scientific calculation I find ipython to be better suited
2016-08-13 18:14:42	@meskarune	I use the python console as a calculator lol
2016-08-13 18:14:53	fsckd	meskarune: what sort of emails are expected? and should mentors be given access?
2016-08-13 18:15:10	@meskarune	fsckd: I would expect mentee's asking for a mentor to email there
2016-08-13 18:15:26	@meskarune	we just need some public contacts to wrangle things
2016-08-13 18:15:38	fsckd	yeah ok
2016-08-13 18:15:45	@meskarune	public contacts have to be prepared to deal with conflicts and abuse and whatever else
2016-08-13 18:17:47	fsckd	ok, that's a good idea.
2016-08-13 18:18:24	@meskarune	I think having like 3-4 people would be good
2016-08-13 18:18:27	@meskarune	I can do it
2016-08-13 18:19:54	fsckd	may be i could too :)
2016-08-13 18:20:23	fsckd	ok, anything else for mentorship?
2016-08-13 18:21:06	pid1	j605: i don't do anything that fancy :)
2016-08-13 18:21:08	@meskarune	I think thats all, vetting process, online form, email setup
2016-08-13 18:21:19	@meskarune	heh "thats all"
2016-08-13 18:21:36	fsckd	hehe
2016-08-13 18:21:50	fsckd	Any final comments, questions, etc.?
2016-08-13 18:22:22	fsckd	(I had one but forgot it.)
2016-08-13 18:26:24	fsckd	Ok. I think that's it.

2016-08-13 18:26:39	fsckd	========== 51st Meeting Stop ==========
2016-08-13 18:26:40	j605	What is the mentoring about? Do you have a page about it?
2016-08-13 18:27:20	@meskarune	j605: basically one on one help with technical things
2016-08-13 18:27:32	@meskarune	its not teaching the person, just helping them when they get stuck with something
2016-08-13 18:28:10	@meskarune	mentees will primarily be women or other disadvantaged groups
2016-08-13 18:30:37	@meskarune	I've actually been mentoring like 2 people
2016-08-13 18:30:41	@meskarune	in sysadmin stuff

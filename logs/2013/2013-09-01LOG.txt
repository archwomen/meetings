2013-09-01 12:28:13	+meskarune	ok, announcements
2013-09-01 12:28:21	+meskarune	is gtmanfred or kaictl around?
2013-09-01 12:28:24	+meskarune	:)
2013-09-01 12:29:02	+meskarune	The first PKGBUILD class will be on September 14th at 17:00 UTC
2013-09-01 12:29:10	+meskarune	tell your friends, advertise, etc :)
2013-09-01 12:29:38	+meskarune	maybe that could be added to the topic in -classroom and -women
2013-09-01 12:29:51	+meskarune	and I'll add an event or something to the blog?
2013-09-01 12:30:03	+tigrmesh	yes
2013-09-01 12:30:23	+meskarune	I'm excited about it
2013-09-01 12:31:08	+tigrmesh	and twitter.  i've never understood the appeal of a cli client for twitter.  i finally "get" it.  i need to make updating twitter much easier
2013-09-01 12:31:12	+tigrmesh	me too
2013-09-01 12:32:19	+meskarune	yeah, cli client means you don't have to use a browser, and you can read updates in your terminal, or even stick them on conky, etc
2013-09-01 12:32:27	+meskarune	the twitter page can be pretty slow loading :(
2013-09-01 12:32:49	+tigrmesh	just for tweeting would be great
2013-09-01 12:32:57	manfred	i am at work
2013-09-01 12:33:06	+tigrmesh	hi
2013-09-01 12:33:17	+tigrmesh	updates on the class, manfred?
2013-09-01 12:33:21	<--	Chris_TR (~chris@187-178-35-237.dynamic.axtel.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2013-09-01 12:33:27	manfred	nope, just that it is still on
2013-09-01 12:33:42	manfred	i have to go back to work
2013-09-01 12:33:46	+tigrmesh	bai
2013-09-01 12:35:39	+meskarune	I might work on a twitter python thingy after the meeting
2013-09-01 12:35:46	+meskarune	and we could have other things use it as well
2013-09-01 12:36:06	+meskarune	need to make a push to finish up the site I think
2013-09-01 12:36:30	+meskarune	and if there are suggestions, people can email us, or post in irc or use git, etc
2013-09-01 12:36:45	+meskarune	like resources page, I want to list debian women, ubuntu women, linux chix, etc
2013-09-01 12:40:06	+meskarune	ok, so projects
2013-09-01 12:40:42	+meskarune	I'd like to see a mini-class on using git. we can use the test git repo on the server to help
2013-09-01 12:40:51	+meskarune	maybe we can set a date and then get the word out
2013-09-01 12:41:30	+meskarune	I'm pretty much available everyday any time
2013-09-01 12:42:03	+tigrmesh	anyone willing to head that up?  or at least work with meskarune about what it should cover?
2013-09-01 12:45:30	+meskarune	we can use the docs on the wiki for git
2013-09-01 12:46:04	+meskarune	adding to a repo consists of 3 commands, and there are gui clients too
2013-09-01 12:46:19	+meskarune	that show changes and things
2013-09-01 12:47:09	+meskarune	I think kaictl  might have been interested
2013-09-01 12:47:15	+meskarune	I have to look at the last meeting
2013-09-01 12:48:30	+meskarune	we can recruit a bit. the git class doesn't need to be super formal since using git isn't too complicated, though it does have a learning curve
2013-09-01 12:48:44	+meskarune	maybe people can jump in too
2013-09-01 12:48:57	+meskarune	my internets is laggy
2013-09-01 12:48:59	+meskarune	:(
2013-09-01 12:49:38	+meskarune	kk, install day?
2013-09-01 12:49:56	+meskarune	we could have one next weekend?
2013-09-01 12:50:01	+meskarune	idk
2013-09-01 12:53:17	+meskarune	I'll make a blog post on what you need for install day, and when it is :)
2013-09-01 12:57:01	+meskarune	back online
2013-09-01 12:57:51	+meskarune	so maybe install day can be sept 7th?
2013-09-01 12:58:04	+meskarune	and we can have another a few months after
2013-09-01 12:58:46	+tigrmesh	is sept 7 too soon?
2013-09-01 12:59:48	+meskarune	not sure
2013-09-01 13:00:01	+meskarune	do we need a lot of marketing for install days?
2013-09-01 13:00:14	+meskarune	there is the pkgbuild class the next weekend after the 7th
2013-09-01 13:00:24	+tigrmesh	right

2013-09-01 13:42:26	hh4a	meskarune: you seen one at pwmt http://bugs.pwmt.org/
2013-09-01 13:42:27	phrik	Title: Dashboard - mothra bug tracker (at bugs.pwmt.org)
2013-09-01 13:43:46	hh4a	ugh sorry, looks like its a special theme, iam up for tinyissue!
2013-09-01 13:46:53	+meskarune	kk
2013-09-01 13:46:56	+meskarune	:)
2013-09-01 13:47:32	+meskarune	we need to finish converting the old blog posts to new blog
2013-09-01 13:47:50	+meskarune	I can tweak the submit form and then its a simple copy paste submit with that
2013-09-01 13:47:56	+meskarune	its almost done
2013-09-01 13:48:01	+meskarune	about 20 more pages to go
2013-09-01 13:48:08	hh4a	meskarune: i love what you did with the site, looks awesome
2013-09-01 13:48:13	+meskarune	:D
2013-09-01 13:48:33	+meskarune	still needs lots of work
2013-09-01 13:49:05	+tigrmesh	i said i would look into mantis (i think that was the name), but i haven't
2013-09-01 13:49:31	hh4a	so redmine is in phasing out?
2013-09-01 13:49:33	+tigrmesh	and i cannot remember if kaictl looked into making trac more usable for us
2013-09-01 13:49:34	hh4a	mantis is eek
2013-09-01 13:49:47	hh4a	naah no trac please...
2013-09-01 13:50:04	+meskarune	trac has a terrible search function and doesn't index things well
2013-09-01 13:50:33	+meskarune	so its hard to find information
2013-09-01 13:50:44	+tigrmesh	hh4a: redmine is resource intensive. 1) ruby is a hog, 2) lots of admin an upgrades on both ruby and redmine
2013-09-01 13:51:03	+tigrmesh	other than that, it's pretty...
2013-09-01 13:51:11	+meskarune	and redmine compiles in configuration options
2013-09-01 13:54:06	hh4a	hmm but redmine is pretty much defacto lol
2013-09-01 13:55:00	+tigrmesh	?
2013-09-01 13:55:45	hh4a	oh nothing, i elevate issue tracking decisions to you, not my cup of tea.
2013-09-01 13:56:47	+meskarune	I like the redmine user interface, it looks nice and is pretty easy to use, but a pain to admin
2013-09-01 13:57:35	-->	fsckd (~joggle@april-fools/runnerup/fsckd) has joined #archlinux-women
2013-09-01 13:58:40	+meskarune	we'll keep working on it, and maybe install a few things on teh server to test
2013-09-01 13:59:05	hh4a	oh
2013-09-01 14:00:44	+meskarune	I forget where we are at in teh meeting
2013-09-01 14:01:14	+meskarune	so I guess community stuff?
2013-09-01 14:01:45	+meskarune	we need to buff up the resources page: https://archwomen.org/resources/
2013-09-01 14:01:46	phrik	Title: Arch Linux Women | Resources (at archwomen.org)
2013-09-01 14:02:04	+meskarune	and add like info on contributing to arch linux, info on the arch irc and forum mods, etc
2013-09-01 14:02:11	+meskarune	and links to other similar projects
2013-09-01 14:02:34	+meskarune	people can pm us links, or add them with git, or just email us some things :)
2013-09-01 14:03:07	+meskarune	we need to make soem marketing materials
2013-09-01 14:03:34	+meskarune	I was thinking maybe a flyer that says "arch women like to K.I.S.S (keep it simple stupid)"
2013-09-01 14:03:54	+meskarune	and then put the url and irc chan on there
2013-09-01 14:04:09	+meskarune	and we could do an install day flyer
2013-09-01 14:13:21	hh4a	hmm behold http://www.welovemetal.com/newsite/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/KISS2.gif, having a head with aw logo tattoo and blue lips and below KISS, heh that would be too obvious
2013-09-01 14:14:02	fsckd	tinyissue uses github as their bug tracker :P
2013-09-01 14:17:16	hh4a	fsckd: oh the irony
2013-09-01 14:18:00	+meskarune	hehe
2013-09-01 14:20:09	fsckd	on the old site there was a list of affiliated projects
2013-09-01 14:20:12	numeral	wait... what
2013-09-01 14:20:29	+meskarune	yeah, we can get that off the database :)
2013-09-01 14:20:37	+meskarune	and add in new stuff too
2013-09-01 14:25:52	+tigrmesh	i'd like to put the resources in the wiki
2013-09-01 14:25:57	+tigrmesh	so people can add to it
2013-09-01 14:27:01	+tigrmesh	so if hh4a has an account on the wiki and reads that there's a tinyissue-women, he can add it  ;)
2013-09-01 14:29:27	+meskarune	oh good idea tigrmesh 
2013-09-01 14:30:10	+tigrmesh	also, and i think this is a technical issue someone might get into wrapping their mind around, it would be nice for someone to get one login and have it cover both the issue tracker and the wiki.  since they're 2 different pieces of software, doing that is a technical issue.  that's why you need a separate login for everything on the arch site - bbs, wiki, bugtracker.  they're 3 different pieces of
2013-09-01 14:30:10	+tigrmesh	software
2013-09-01 14:31:40	+meskarune	yeah, maybe we could somehow have the user info transfered over
2013-09-01 14:31:46	+meskarune	from one database to the other
2013-09-01 14:31:52	+meskarune	or use open auth
2013-09-01 14:33:22	-->	enixam (~maxine@dsl-66-36-145-6.mtl.aei.ca) has joined #archlinux-women
2013-09-01 14:33:42	hh4a	open auth could work
2013-09-01 14:35:23	+meskarune	and open id
2013-09-01 14:35:31	+meskarune	most things have a plugin for that
2013-09-01 14:35:40	+meskarune	and people can use the same login for everything
2013-09-01 14:37:03	hh4a	yeah we could do that
2013-09-01 14:38:31	+meskarune	it is good and bad. if you have the same sign on for all accounts, if someone gets that sign on, they can access all of your stuff
2013-09-01 14:39:02	+meskarune	so instead of a single site compromise, you have tons of data compromised
2013-09-01 14:39:09	hh4a	are we prepared to take such a risk?
2013-09-01 14:39:27	+meskarune	you take that risk every time you use open id to log into something :)
2013-09-01 14:39:36	+meskarune	or use the same user/pass on multiple sites
2013-09-01 14:39:40	+tigrmesh	i'd rather have a home-grown thing
2013-09-01 14:39:55	+tigrmesh	as long as some community member is willing to try it out
2013-09-01 14:40:25	+tigrmesh	i know we've got lots of people here who have the skills and are into cool software projects
2013-09-01 14:43:17	+meskarune	yeah, I know other people do it
2013-09-01 14:43:37	+meskarune	I think oauth is mostly used, site 1 is oauth server, other sites use info from site 1
2013-09-01 14:44:50	+meskarune	i'm not incredibly familiar though
2013-09-01 14:44:54	+meskarune	I think you can use cookies too
2013-09-01 14:46:15	Nisstyre	tigrmesh: it would have to be patches to all the different pieces of software
2013-09-01 14:46:41	Nisstyre	certainly possible to do, they probably use similar methods of authentication
2013-09-01 14:47:49	hh4a	openid down the road
2013-09-01 14:48:47	+meskarune	I guess you have a central user login database that the sites use?
2013-09-01 14:49:05	+meskarune	so patch doku wiki to use the database instead of its own thing, and same with other sites
2013-09-01 14:51:02	+meskarune	doku wiki has an auth.php I believe that can be patched to something custom
2013-09-01 14:51:30	Nisstyre	yeah it would probably be fairly straightforward
2013-09-01 14:51:34	Nisstyre	assuming the code is readable
2013-09-01 14:51:38	+meskarune	hehe
2013-09-01 14:51:55	+meskarune	I smell a pet peeve ;)
2013-09-01 14:52:06	Nisstyre	yeah, I haven't had great experiences with php
2013-09-01 14:52:25	+meskarune	I don't like writing the syntax, and people often write it messy
2013-09-01 14:52:31	+meskarune	but it gets the job done. lol
2013-09-01 14:52:41	Nisstyre	it's not the syntax, the language is unpredictable wrt type conversion rules
2013-09-01 14:52:46	Nisstyre	and a lot of things are just unexpected
2013-09-01 14:53:05	kaictl	use python!
2013-09-01 14:53:13	Nisstyre	I use Haskell for a lot of things
2013-09-01 14:53:31	kaictl	use !php!
2013-09-01 14:54:24	+meskarune	:P
2013-09-01 14:54:36	+meskarune	ok, we'll make an issue for that :)
2013-09-01 14:54:50	+meskarune	user database that all sites can use for auth
2013-09-01 14:55:13	+meskarune	ok, mission statement?
2013-09-01 15:00:00	+meskarune	we to have a mission statement about our primary goal/reason for existing
2013-09-01 15:00:02	+meskarune	:)
2013-09-01 15:02:01	+meskarune	only 2 things left on the agenda, mission statement and blog post requests 
2013-09-01 15:02:33	+meskarune	we'd like more people to write posts, about why they use arch, or use linux, a project they are working on, or a cook thing that happened, etc
2013-09-01 15:02:36	+meskarune	its pretty open ended
2013-09-01 15:02:55	-->	camilasan (~camilasan@91-64-83-129-dynip.superkabel.de) has joined #archlinux-women
2013-09-01 15:02:58	hh4a	oh mission statement, hmm ugh nothing comes to my mind... :sadface:
2013-09-01 15:04:54	+tigrmesh	maybe a small group for that and then discuss at a regular meeting.  and the small group not meet in here
2013-09-01 15:05:02	+meskarune	for hte mission statement I was thinking maybe "help increase the community involvement of women in Arch Linux and FOSS though networking and learning"
2013-09-01 15:05:29	+meskarune	only better 'cus I'm not good at that sort of thing
2013-09-01 15:05:38	+tigrmesh	good start
2013-09-01 15:05:42	+meskarune	maybe talk about making women's involvement in foss more visible 
2013-09-01 15:06:05	+tigrmesh	who'd like to be involved in that?  looks like it will be a pretty quick thing
2013-09-01 15:06:14	+tigrmesh	*discussion
2013-09-01 15:06:39	+tigrmesh	anyone?
2013-09-01 15:06:47	+meskarune	basically just need a simple and clear mission statement that we can spam all over the place
2013-09-01 15:07:18	hh4a	oh sorry iam kinda spaced out
2013-09-01 15:07:50	+meskarune	me too
2013-09-01 15:07:54	+meskarune	:(
2013-09-01 15:08:14	+meskarune	been feeling spacey all day, so meeting is completely chaotic
2013-09-01 15:08:16	+meskarune	lol
2013-09-01 15:08:28	hh4a	yeah
2013-09-01 15:08:52	+tigrmesh	i think we all are.  that's why i think a small group would be good
2013-09-01 15:09:53	+meskarune	++
2013-09-01 15:09:57	+tigrmesh	anyone interested in writing it can see meskarune, even if all you do is prettify the wording.  meskarune, are you willing to recruit people for it if no one volunteers?
2013-09-01 15:10:07	+meskarune	sure :)
2013-09-01 15:10:33	+meskarune	I'll make a riseup pad thingy, and brainstorm, and people can just join and add when they have time?
2013-09-01 15:11:31	+tigrmesh	however you want to do it.  it would be nice to have something for our next meeting.  i know of at least one person who wasn't sure what we're about, so they left
2013-09-01 15:11:56	hh4a	aye
2013-09-01 15:12:05	+meskarune	yeah, people on first look don't understand why we exist

2013-09-01 15:18:08	+meskarune	ok, made a start on it
2013-09-01 15:23:44	+tigrmesh	are we on to the next item?
2013-09-01 15:25:32	+meskarune	yeah, I think so :)
2013-09-01 15:26:47	+tigrmesh	ok.  so.  i'll be approaching people and asking for a quick writeup or something i can write up about "What arch women means to me" or "Why I participate in arch women"
2013-09-01 15:27:38	+tigrmesh	and if you want to tell me the answers to these, i'd love that
2013-09-01 15:28:06	+tigrmesh	i thought this could be a recurring feature on the blog and/or a regularly updated wiki or static page
2013-09-01 15:28:29	+meskarune	yeah, sounds awesome
2013-09-01 15:29:43	+tigrmesh	also, if you have any ideas for blog posts that you think would be of interest to arch women people, write them up or let meskarune, me or fsckd know
2013-09-01 15:31:01	+tigrmesh	also any cool links/info for scholarships or internships for people in tech (like google SoC)
2013-09-01 15:31:26	+meskarune	I need to go through scroll back for links
2013-09-01 15:31:35	+meskarune	lots of cool things have been posted in teh channel alone
2013-09-01 15:31:37	+meskarune	:)
2013-09-01 15:31:41	+tigrmesh	especially, but not entirely, for those specifically aimed at women
2013-09-01 15:31:46	+tigrmesh	yeah
2013-09-01 15:32:21	+tigrmesh	there was something else, but i forget
2013-09-01 15:33:16	+tigrmesh	one other thing.  that "why i participate in arch women" thing?  just a sentence or a short paragraph is fine.  long one is fine too
2013-09-01 15:36:54	+tigrmesh	ok
2013-09-01 15:37:08	+tigrmesh	anyone see an agenda item we haven't covered?  https://pad.riseup.net/p/aw2013sept

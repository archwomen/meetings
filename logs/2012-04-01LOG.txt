Apr 01 12:08:46 .:@meskarune:.	!archwomen
Apr 01 12:08:48 .:phrik:.	http://archwomen.org
Apr 01 12:08:54 .:code_astronomer:.	is the meeting now?
Apr 01 12:09:07 .:fsckd:.	code_astronomer: any minute
Apr 01 12:09:11 .:code_astronomer:.	OK
Apr 01 12:09:48 .:@meskarune:.	Ok
Apr 01 12:09:58 .:Silvah:.	oK
Apr 01 12:10:00 .:@meskarune:.	Official start the second archwomen meeting is.....
Apr 01 12:10:00 .:qubodup:.	go go go?
Apr 01 12:10:02 .:@meskarune:.	NOW

Apr 01 12:10:18 ---Â»	joyfulgirl (~joyfulgir@unaffiliated/joyfulgirl) has Joined #archlinux-women
Apr 01 12:10:19 Â»Â»	code_astronomer stops clapping
Apr 01 12:10:23 .:@meskarune:.	so first thing: great job on everything we've acomplished in the last month
Apr 01 12:10:28 .:@meskarune:.	I can't thank all of you enough
Apr 01 12:10:32 .:fsckd:.	:)
Apr 01 12:11:07 .:@meskarune:.	So first thing on the agenda: Teaching / Mentorship Program
Apr 01 12:11:43 .:@meskarune:.	some suggested ideas were to have certain times set for teaching, or to have a "class" setup
Apr 01 12:11:44 .:@meskarune:.	etc
Apr 01 12:12:14 .:@meskarune:.	idk how formal you guys/gals want this to be
Apr 01 12:12:26 Â»Â»	fsckd is curious
Apr 01 12:12:30 .:code_astronomer:.	I guess there should be an option
Apr 01 12:12:54 .:@meskarune:.	I could teach a class on making PKGBUILDS (with some help) 
Apr 01 12:13:01 .:code_astronomer:.	to improve oneself is desirable
Apr 01 12:13:24 .:@meskarune:.	and maybe we could have someone in the european time zone teach so they have one at a time that isn't crazy
Apr 01 12:13:34 .:@meskarune:.	!ubuntu classroom
Apr 01 12:13:34 -Notice-	{from phrik} Error: "ubuntu" is not a valid command.
Apr 01 12:13:38 .:code_astronomer:.	I'm actually interested in pkgbuilds at the moment... and if there's someone to chat with instead of going alone with documentation, that'd be cool
Apr 01 12:13:42 .:@meskarune:.	!g ubuntu classroom
Apr 01 12:13:43 <phrik>	meskarune: Classroom - Ubuntu Wiki: <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Classroom>
Apr 01 12:14:27 .:@meskarune:.	code_astronomer: yeah, I'm thinking it will be a lot easier and people will be more motivated to contribute if they have a "class" to take and maybe times when they can come online and have someone to talk to
Apr 01 12:14:42 .:code_astronomer:.	exactly.
Apr 01 12:14:50 .:qubodup:.	so one task could be to investigate ubuntu classroom practices more, interviewing them about their process and success with it to then make a suggesion what archwomen can do
Apr 01 12:15:01 .:@meskarune:.	yeah
Apr 01 12:15:06 <joyfulgirl>	meskarune: You might talk to some of the folks at linuxchix.org; I know they used to have classes for a while
Apr 01 12:15:17 .:@meskarune:.	oh awesome. thanks joyfulgirl :)
Apr 01 12:15:20 .:joyfulgirl:.	np
Apr 01 12:15:22 .:joyfulgirl:.	(-:
Apr 01 12:15:27 .:code_astronomer:.	documentation is fine, and being a long term linux user, I'm used to it, but it's always more friendly to chat with others and documentation can't answer questions or give "experience" advice
Apr 01 12:15:54 .:qubodup:.	joyfulgirl: you mean http://www.linuxchix.org/content/courses/ ?
Apr 01 12:15:56 .:phrik:.	Title: LinuxChix course information (at www.linuxchix.org)
Apr 01 12:16:17 .:@meskarune:.	one great thing is that PKGBUILDS are bash
Apr 01 12:16:26 .:joyfulgirl:.	qubodup: Yup!
Apr 01 12:16:30 .:@meskarune:.	so people can study bash scripting as they learn to write PKGBUILDS
Apr 01 12:16:37 .:@meskarune:.	and bash has a TON of documentation
Apr 01 12:16:38 .:Silvah:.	That's a bad thing.
Apr 01 12:16:48 .:code_astronomer:.	why bad?
Apr 01 12:16:56 .:@meskarune:.	its easier to use than debian's packaging system :P
Apr 01 12:17:12 .:code_astronomer:.	bash is pretty much known by any linux user
Apr 01 12:17:27 .:@meskarune:.	Silvah: I can image it getting confusing if someone learns bash and PKGBUILDS at the same time
Apr 01 12:17:40 .:@meskarune:.	so I'll try and make the class very clear
Apr 01 12:17:48 .:@meskarune:.	how about this: we work on class materials 
Apr 01 12:17:54 .:@meskarune:.	like maybe I could set up a wiki?
Apr 01 12:18:00 .:@meskarune:.	with homework assignments
Apr 01 12:18:05 .:Silvah:.	code_astronomer: for it's bash, and bash sucks.
Apr 01 12:18:22 .:code_astronomer:.	Silvah: I disagree, but..
Apr 01 12:18:28 .:fsckd:.	whether bash sucks or not is kind of outside the scope of this meeting
Apr 01 12:19:04 .:+tigrmesh:.	but it's so very arch to have opinions about it  ;)
Apr 01 12:19:17 .:@meskarune:.	well, PKGBUILDS are based off bash, so I'd do a basic bash intro I guess, and talk about making PKGBUILDS
Apr 01 12:19:30 .:@meskarune:.	and probably talk a little about the compilation process?
Apr 01 12:19:51 <qubodup>	meskarune: I would absolutely try to use the official archwiki
Apr 01 12:20:06 .:fsckd:.	i agree with qubodup
Apr 01 12:20:09 .:@meskarune:.	qubodup: http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting
Apr 01 12:20:11 .:phrik:.	Title: Bash Shell Scripting - Wikibooks, open books for an open world (at en.wikibooks.org)
Apr 01 12:20:19 .:@meskarune:.	I was sorta thinking along the lines of that
Apr 01 12:20:28 .:@meskarune:.	with like, homework assignments and answers 
Apr 01 12:20:31 .:code_astronomer:.	but like I said ... documentation is the first step, but it's not the same as talking with friendly people and getting more info
Apr 01 12:20:42 .:@meskarune:.	you think it would be ok to put a PKGBUILD course on the official wiki?
Apr 01 12:20:45 <code_astronomer>	what meskarune can do is expand in a more personal way
Apr 01 12:21:10 .:fsckd:.	the classes would be like a seminar, back and forth interaction
Apr 01 12:21:14 .:@meskarune:.	yeah
Apr 01 12:21:16 Â»Â»	fsckd hates homework :P
Apr 01 12:21:18 .:@meskarune:.	and like, code examples
Apr 01 12:21:30 Â«---	julius2 (~julius@unaffiliated/julius2) has Left #archlinux-women
Apr 01 12:21:45 <qubodup>	meskarune: I think this might make sense for bash, since there is no official bash wiki. with arch it might be wise to try to use the official wiki if archwiki authoroties agree
Apr 01 12:21:48 .:@meskarune:.	fsckd: not like "homework homework" just code examples and maybe something like, "try this out and see what you can do"
Apr 01 12:22:06 .:code_astronomer:.	fsckd: F!
Apr 01 12:22:13 .:fsckd:.	:(
Apr 01 12:22:17 .:code_astronomer:.	hehe

Apr 01 12:23:24 .:+tigrmesh:.	i'm not sure about using the arch wiki.  what if this spread to other pages?  i hate it when i'm trying to get an answer, and all i get is questions
Apr 01 12:23:27 .:@meskarune:.	ok, so ideas so far: make up a few examples of the PKGBUILDING process
Apr 01 12:23:34 .:@meskarune:.	and maybe put them on the wiki
Apr 01 12:23:43 .:code_astronomer:.	I there are examples already
Apr 01 12:23:59 .:code_astronomer:.	I think
Apr 01 12:24:00 .:code_astronomer:.	there
Apr 01 12:24:10 .:@meskarune:.	code_astronomer: I mean like, starting from the very beging. #1. look at the source readme
Apr 01 12:24:11 .:@meskarune:.	ect
Apr 01 12:24:18 .:code_astronomer:.	ah ok
Apr 01 12:24:29 .:@meskarune:.	tigrmesh: yeah, I'm not sure if it would be appropriate to use the official wiki or not. 
Apr 01 12:25:24 .:fsckd:.	actual PKGBUILDs are excellent examples, i see no reason to duplicate them, a simple link would work
Apr 01 12:25:26 .:@meskarune:.	I want to do step by step with like, a regular package that installs with /configure make make install. and then maybe show PKGBUILDS for java, ruby programs, etc
Apr 01 12:25:37 Â»Â»	code_astronomer says beer has arrived.. passes them out
Apr 01 12:25:46 .:qubodup:.	fsckd: picking out excellent examples might be good
Apr 01 12:25:53 <Silvah>	meskarune: set up your own wiki, maybe?
Apr 01 12:25:54 .:@meskarune:.	fsckd: so should I just add in information on locating the install information in source packages? 
Apr 01 12:25:57 .:qubodup:.	fsckd: creating commented versions might be useful as well
Apr 01 12:26:19 .:fsckd:.	for complex stuff that would be good
Apr 01 12:27:16 <qubodup>	meskarune: why ruby, java? because their processes are different from c programs?
Apr 01 12:27:17 .:joyfulgirl:.	Also, newer features such as split packaging could be interesting; also, maybe a (brief) discussion of the general best practices on where to put stuff
Apr 01 12:27:24 .:@meskarune:.	qubodup: yeah
Apr 01 12:27:37 .:@meskarune:.	their PKGBUILDS are different
Apr 01 12:27:46 <qubodup>	meskarune: this sounds more and more like improving the PKGBUILD documentation in general
Apr 01 12:27:52 .:@meskarune:.	yeah I think so 
Apr 01 12:28:07 .:qubodup:.	java, ruby and RCS (svn, git..) might be too specialized for courses
Apr 01 12:28:15 .:qubodup:.	although I believe that they are very important
Apr 01 12:28:31 .:@meskarune:.	I guess I can start out simple, and get more indepth as people learn....?
Apr 01 12:29:01 .:joyfulgirl:.	Sure; that way you could also see where people's interest lies
Apr 01 12:29:07 .:fsckd:.	baby's first PKGBUILD :P
Apr 01 12:29:08 .:qubodup:.	I would suggest having a simple course and trying to put specific info into the general documentation (it probably is already there but probably messy)
Apr 01 12:29:16 .:@meskarune:.	so PKGBUILD examples with comments and increase the information on the wiki. maybe call it the begingers guide to making PKGBUILDS  ?
Apr 01 12:29:59 .:@meskarune:.	sorta like the begings guide to installing archlinux
Apr 01 12:30:18 .:@meskarune:.	make a step by step guide on the wiki?
Apr 01 12:30:34 .:@meskarune:.	and then set up a class and withint the class adopt orphan packages?
Apr 01 12:30:36 .:fsckd:.	wait... was the whole tutorial idea just about PKGBUILDs?
Apr 01 12:30:51 .:qubodup:.	it seems like a good start
Apr 01 12:31:20 .:+tigrmesh:.	sounds ambitious, but great
Apr 01 12:31:33 .:@meskarune:.	fsckd: I think it would be awesome to teach other things as well, but people have expressed an interest in learning to maintain packages and arch linux has a huge need for that anyways
Apr 01 12:32:05 ---Â»	keenerd (~kyle@archlinux/trusteduser/keenerd) has Joined #archlinux-women
Apr 01 12:32:18 .:fsckd:.	ok, so a PKGBUILD class to start the tutorial system
Apr 01 12:32:19 .:@meskarune:.	I really think it would be great to create class materials that anyone could use to teach a class
Apr 01 12:32:24 .:@meskarune:.	fsckd: yeah
Apr 01 12:32:24 .:@meskarune:.	:)
Apr 01 12:33:09 <qubodup>	meskarune: this material might already exist on ubuntu classroom and or linuxchix courses
Apr 01 12:33:51 .:qubodup:.	added  "*or* to make it easy for people to start classes on their own" to investigating UC/LCC
Apr 01 12:33:54 .:@meskarune:.	qubodup: yeah. I'm sure we can get a lot of information from other places, and then put it in the arch wiki in an organized manner. I bet people from #archlinux would help out too since its to their advantage
Apr 01 12:35:35 .:qubodup:.	if the info is already structurized on UC/LCC, then perhaps it would not need to be copied... hm.
Apr 01 12:35:39 .:fsckd:.	from UC website, people submit proposals for a class which gets accepted or not
Apr 01 12:35:39 .:@meskarune:.	maybe I can start a forum thread on creating a beginners guide to PKGBUILDing and maintaining?
Apr 01 12:36:01 <qubodup>	meskarune: either that or use the PKGBUILD wiki discussion page
Apr 01 12:36:13 .:@meskarune:.	oh ok good idea :)
Apr 01 12:36:20 .:qubodup:.	although I believe arch documentation (on wiki) states that forum should be used for discussing wiki too
Apr 01 12:36:40 .:fsckd:.	forum/wiki section of forum :)
Apr 01 12:36:45 .:qubodup:.	:)
Apr 01 12:36:50 .:@meskarune:.	I'm really excited about this :D
Apr 01 12:36:59 .:@meskarune:.	it would help out arch linux a lot
Apr 01 12:37:06 .:fsckd:.	yeah XD
Apr 01 12:37:12 .:qubodup:.	I had a lot of fun editing the "getting started" section of the wiki last month
Apr 01 12:37:35 .:fsckd:.	thanks for that qubodup :)
Apr 01 12:38:30 .:qubodup:.	hopefully it helped but I invite you all to look over it and comment/edit :)
Apr 01 12:38:42 .:@meskarune:.	ok, so first get get the documentation together, and then later schedule classes and find teachers...?
Apr 01 12:39:46 .:qubodup:.	I have my doubts that we will be able to completely work through PKGBUILD documentation. I believe there are at least 3 long wiki pages on it?
Apr 01 12:40:02 .:qubodup:.	we might want to start a class/tutorial and work on general doc in parallel?
Apr 01 12:40:27 .:fsckd:.	i vote parallel
Apr 01 12:40:28 .:qubodup:.	'generral doc' meaning the wiki pages that already are in place on the wiki about PKGBUILDs
Apr 01 12:40:34 .:@meskarune:.	yeah, and I think if we make a forum thread and discussion on the wiki, more people will add to it
Apr 01 12:40:46 .:qubodup:.	(and AUR and ABS, since they probably repeat much info on these pages)
Apr 01 12:40:49 .:fsckd:.	how do you plan to find teachers?
Apr 01 12:40:52 .:@meskarune:.	and make the documentation clearer and easier to read
Apr 01 12:41:33 .:@meskarune:.	fsckd: I'm thinking I might make general announcements on the mailing lists, forums, IRC, etc and get a list of names together
Apr 01 12:41:48 <qubodup>	meskarune: I agree that forum would bring more people to discuss. I want to warn that there are likely to be trolls and that not every user's input should be taken into consideration. but I'm being pessimistic :)
Apr 01 12:41:58 .:@meskarune:.	hehe
Apr 01 12:42:14 .:@meskarune:.	well, the forum mods do a good job in trying to keep things on there in check
Apr 01 12:42:19 .:qubodup:.	fsckd: I wonder about that as well (finding teachers)
Apr 01 12:42:21 .:@meskarune:.	espeically since there are so few
Apr 01 12:42:40 .:Silvah:.	Don't even get me started on forum mods.
Apr 01 12:42:45 .:fsckd:.	lol
Apr 01 12:43:18 .:@meskarune:.	qubodup: I think if we make it as easy as possible for someone to teach by having good teaching materials made, it won't be too difficult to find people
Apr 01 12:43:21 .:qubodup:.	about the PKGBUILD tutorial/homework. is there a link somebody wants to suggest as inspiration?
Apr 01 12:43:44 .:fsckd:.	man PKGBUILD ?
Apr 01 12:44:00 .:Silvah:.	They do everything but a good job.
Apr 01 12:44:04 .:qubodup:.	fsckd: I mean more like "homeworks" created on ubuntu classroom or something
Apr 01 12:44:12 .:fsckd:.	oh, sorry
Apr 01 12:44:49 .:qubodup:.	are we talking about the same thing?
Apr 01 12:44:58 .:qubodup:.	I mean "Write beginners guide to making PKGBUILDS (on archwiki?)
Apr 01 12:45:01 .:qubodup:.	"
Apr 01 12:45:13 .:@meskarune:.	http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Bash_Shell_Scripting#Some introductory examples
Apr 01 12:45:15 .:phrik:.	Title: Bash Shell Scripting - Wikibooks, open books for an open world (at en.wikibooks.org)
Apr 01 12:45:49 .:@meskarune:.	I'm thinking like that. we have the process of building a PKGBUILD and putting that PKGBUILD in AUR step by step so anyone can sit down and follow along
Apr 01 12:46:01 .:@meskarune:.	and then have examples of PKGBUILDS with lots of comments
Apr 01 12:46:08 .:@meskarune:.	?
Apr 01 12:46:11 .:qubodup:.	I think it should be a 'learning by doing' type documentation, allowing a user to create one pkgbuild without having to understand everything they do?
Apr 01 12:46:18 .:@meskarune:.	yeah
Apr 01 12:46:31 .:@meskarune:.	its like the arch wiki beginners guide
Apr 01 12:46:43 .:@meskarune:.	they walk you through, and explain a bit, but link to more indepth articles
Apr 01 12:46:43 .:fsckd:.	one thing, would a beginners' guide to PKGBUILDs in addition to existing docs be more like spoon feeding?
Apr 01 12:47:23 .:qubodup:.	fsckd: I believe yes. spoon feeding for the first steps, to get users going.
Apr 01 12:47:39 .:@meskarune:.	fsckd: well, it would just be a step by step tutorial on making and uploading an Arch PKGBUILD, and then link to the other documentation. so people have a starting point so to speak
Apr 01 12:47:46 .:qubodup:.	fsckd: does that sound superfluous to you?
Apr 01 12:47:59 <Silvah>	meskarune: a PKGBUILD with lots of comments would be a bad example, good PKBUILD explains itself very well.
Apr 01 12:48:22 .:@meskarune:.	Silvah: so we just put all the explainatins withint the wiki article?
Apr 01 12:48:44 .:@meskarune:.	Silvah: I mostly want to explain all the installation scripts stuff at the bottom :)
Apr 01 12:49:18 .:keenerd:.	Silvah: Only if you already know bash.
Apr 01 12:49:30 .:joyfulgirl:.	I disagree with that, actually; comments in a simple script may be superfluous to an experienced user, but when learning they can only help.
Apr 01 12:49:32 .:qubodup:.	Silvah: you might be right. We'd have to see where the comments are best placed. they are needed for people who see a pkgbuild for the first time. I think there is something already on the wiki
Apr 01 12:50:10 .:Silvah:.	keenerd: I don't know bash, yet I find most PKGBUILDs very readable.
Apr 01 12:50:29 .:joyfulgirl:.	Also, although it is quite possible to have the PKGBUILD (5) manual up alongside your work, it couldn't hurt to have brief descriptions of the various options in an example PKGBUILD.
Apr 01 12:50:45 .:fsckd:.	you would need to know bash to do PKGBUILDs
Apr 01 12:51:09 .:@meskarune:.	Silvah: maybe we can just make something up, and have people look it over to see what is good/bad in comments :)
Apr 01 12:52:11 .:keenerd:.	Any thoughts on improving the quality of the proto pkgbuilds?  (See /usr/share/pacman/* from the abs package.)
Apr 01 12:52:24 .:@meskarune:.	we could have a comment like "below is how you put user instructions in your PKGBUILD" and have an example of "hello world"
Apr 01 12:53:18 .:qubodup:.	I didn't know about man PKGBUILD (which seems to require bash knowledge - I don't know how a bash array works)
Apr 01 12:53:26 .:qubodup:.	I also did not know about /usr/share/pacman
Apr 01 12:53:31 .:joyfulgirl:.	keenerd: I think one important thing would be simply to make more people aware of them; I've often found people who just don't know that they're there.
Apr 01 12:54:03 .:fsckd:.	joyfulgirl: that could serve better as our focus
Apr 01 12:54:03 .:qubodup:.	it might be enough to have a page mostly justexplaining that /usr/share/pacman/ and man PKGBUILD exists) - we'll have to see
Apr 01 12:54:19 .:joyfulgirl:.	Of course, I don't know how exactly to do that, since I think that may be mentioned on the wiki, and is certainly referenced in the SEE ALSO in makepkg(8)
Apr 01 12:54:26 .:qubodup:.	these are now details on how to create such beginner's PKGBUILD documentation
Apr 01 12:54:30 .:fsckd:.	increase awareness of existing resources and suggestions to improve them
Apr 01 12:54:55 .:@meskarune:.	qubodup: we could add that information to the wiki
Apr 01 12:55:03 .:qubodup:.	I'm sure it already is there :D
Apr 01 12:55:12 .:qubodup:.	but if not, absolutely!
Apr 01 12:55:28 .:qubodup:.	if it is there, we will have to see if there is improval of readability required
Apr 01 12:55:35 .:@meskarune:.	and then put links in the PKGBUILD beginners guide?
Apr 01 12:55:37 .:Silvah:.	Ugh, I wanted to remain silent during the meeting ><
Apr 01 12:55:42 .:@meskarune:.	hehe
Apr 01 12:55:49 .:fsckd:.	hi Silvah XD
Apr 01 12:55:59 .:@meskarune:.	speak up Silvah :) its what meetings are for :P
Apr 01 12:56:08 .:qubodup:.	also again, it might make sense to nevertheless make a beginner PKGBUILD documentation/tutorial, as the entire PKGBUILD docuemntation is likely to be large and have a spikey learning curve
Apr 01 12:56:15 .:qubodup:.	Silvah: haha
Apr 01 12:57:18 .:qubodup:.	we are 45 minutes into the meeting
Apr 01 12:57:30 .:fsckd:.	hehe yes
Apr 01 12:57:34 .:@meskarune:.	and still on the first agenda topic :P
Apr 01 12:57:36 .:qubodup:.	I suggest we wrap up "1. Teaching / Mentorship"?
Apr 01 12:58:12 .:qubodup:.	hm. we did not discuss office hours and/or irc sessions though, did we?
Apr 01 12:58:28 .:qubodup:.	except 'find/create teaching material'?

Apr 01 12:59:19 .:@meskarune:.	qubodup: so I think first we need to make and find teaching material so its as easy as possible for people to run their own class
Apr 01 12:59:24 .:qubodup:.	also --- Â Â Â  after documentation is updated/created we can make a call for teachers and set up classes
Apr 01 12:59:32 .:@meskarune:.	after that is done, we can organize some classes themselves?

Apr 01 13:29:16 <fsckd>	meskarune: links posted on the blog get tweeted?
Apr 01 13:29:31 .:@meskarune:.	and we can post up programing cons and women in tech events as well as classes maybe?
Apr 01 13:29:42 .:@meskarune:.	would twitter be better for that? or the site?
Apr 01 13:30:00 .:qubodup:.	I would use the site, which then automatically twitters?

Apr 01 13:30:14 .:qubodup:.	not sure about creating a feed or calendar
Apr 01 13:30:32 .:@meskarune:.	would a calendar be useful?
Apr 01 13:30:37 .:qubodup:.	this kind of info might be too unstructured for this (events have different parameters and are probably rather individual)
Apr 01 13:30:38 .:@meskarune:.	to put meeting dates on 
Apr 01 13:30:41 .:@meskarune:.	and like other events
Apr 01 13:30:45 .:@meskarune:.	and office hours, etc
Apr 01 13:30:51 .:@meskarune:.	ok, yeah, that woudl be useful for me

Apr 01 13:32:11 .:qubodup:.	I wouldn't know an open source tool to suggest for calendar sharing but it might be not bad

Apr 01 14:05:52 .:phrik:.	Title: TitanPad: MYTjblo5Wt (at titanpad.com)
Apr 01 14:05:53 .:@meskarune:.	its a rough draft
Apr 01 14:06:02 .:@meskarune:.	and then make comments suggestions
Apr 01 14:06:05 .:qubodup:.	also I feel that I've been talking too much during this meeting :)
Apr 01 14:06:12 .:@meskarune:.	I always feel that way
Apr 01 14:06:14 .:@meskarune:.	:P
Apr 01 14:06:31 .:fsckd:.	my turn XD can there be a mailing list? it's clear some topics require more discussion and irc is not the best venue for that
Apr 01 14:07:02 .:qubodup:.	agreed. right now we use b2e's  (archwomen.org cms) discussion features
Apr 01 14:07:17 .:qubodup:.	fsckd: you would prefer an open discussion platform?
Apr 01 14:07:35 .:fsckd:.	yeah, in place of six hour meetings :P
Apr 01 14:07:42 .:qubodup:.	also, comments were used seldomly I believe
Apr 01 14:08:07 .:@meskarune:.	hahaha
Apr 01 14:08:08 .:@meskarune:.	ok
Apr 01 14:08:09 .:@meskarune:.	mailing list
Apr 01 14:08:11 .:@meskarune:.	add that 
Apr 01 14:08:27 .:@meskarune:.	idk what software would be the best to use for one
Apr 01 14:08:36 .:fsckd:.	perhaps we can have a mailing list on arch's system
Apr 01 14:08:46 .:fsckd:.	or if archwomen.org's host has something
Apr 01 14:08:56 .:@meskarune:.	mailman?
Apr 01 14:08:58 .:qubodup:.	I hate mailing lists because I fail to understand whether my messages have been accepted or not and I don't understand whether I have to register before posting or not..
Apr 01 14:09:00 .:@meskarune:.	!g mailman
Apr 01 14:09:02 <phrik>	meskarune: Mailman, the GNU Mailing List Manager: <http://www.gnu.org/s/mailman/index.html>
Apr 01 14:09:19 .:qubodup:.	but at the same time I like mailing lists as they are more comfortable than forums...
Apr 01 14:09:30 .:qubodup:.	alternative would be google groups
Apr 01 14:09:39 .:fsckd:.	qubodup: i check the archives a few hours after posting :)
Apr 01 14:09:49 .:fsckd:.	google groups is an alternative
Apr 01 14:10:05 .:qubodup:.	arch has mailing lists http://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/listinfo/
Apr 01 14:10:06 .:phrik:.	Title: mailman.archlinux.org Mailing Lists (at mailman.archlinux.org)

Apr 01 14:11:35 .:+tigrmesh:.	arch mailing lists tops google groups
Apr 01 14:11:59 .:qubodup:.	we could ask for the creation of arch-women
Apr 01 14:12:03 .:+tigrmesh:.	are we ready to wrap this up?  we've been meeting for more than 2 hours
Apr 01 14:12:10 .:@meskarune:.	yeah, I think so
Apr 01 14:12:10 .:qubodup:.	we could ask for the creation of arch-doc
Apr 01 14:12:33 .:@meskarune:.	qubodup: do you think we could get an official list on the arch mailing list servers...?
Apr 01 14:12:33 .:qubodup:.	we might need an own list, since our topics are not specific to documentation only..
Apr 01 14:12:39 .:@meskarune:.	yeah
Apr 01 14:12:42 <qubodup>	meskarune: I have no idea
Apr 01 14:12:59 .:+tigrmesh:.	it was suggested in the original thread
Apr 01 14:13:00 <qubodup>	meskarune: I suppose we should try
Apr 01 14:13:08 .:fsckd:.	so ask arch devs for a mailing list, if that fails ...
Apr 01 14:14:34 .:@meskarune:.	make our own list?
Apr 01 14:14:52 .:qubodup:.	http://mailman.archlinux.org/mailman/create
Apr 01 14:14:54 .:phrik:.	Title: Create a mailman.archlinux.org Mailing List (at mailman.archlinux.org)
Apr 01 14:14:55 .:@meskarune:.	my hosting service says unlimited bandwidth
Apr 01 14:15:06 .:@meskarune:.	omg awesome
Apr 01 14:15:13 .:qubodup:.	it appears we are welcome to just start a new list?
Apr 01 14:15:26 .:qubodup:.	I suggest the name "arch-women"
Apr 01 14:16:25 <fsckd>	meskarune: you told me that day one! :P
Apr 01 14:16:48 .:qubodup:.	oh wait, you need to have password to create a list
Apr 01 14:16:54 .:fsckd:.	qubodup: may require permission, sort of like seeing a file and lacking write access
Apr 01 14:17:00 .:fsckd:.	yeah...
Apr 01 14:17:02 .:qubodup:.	I was just told on #archlinux that 'phrak' manages mailing lists?
Apr 01 14:17:09 .:@meskarune:.	we'll have to ask someone about it
Apr 01 14:17:12 .:fsckd:.	ok ask him
Apr 01 14:17:32 .:@meskarune:.	so the meeting is officially closed?
Apr 01 14:17:39 .:@meskarune:.	and now we'll get to work ?

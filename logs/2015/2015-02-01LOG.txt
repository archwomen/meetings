2015-02-01 11:35:47	+tigrmesh	thank you to CalimeroTeknik and jy2wong and meskarune for 
2015-02-01 11:35:48	+tigrmesh	all they did to improve the website
2015-02-01 11:36:45	+meskarune	the site is more mobile friendly now :D
2015-02-01 11:36:51	+tigrmesh	yay
2015-02-01 11:37:09	CalimeroTeknik	does the site represent the actual status of the project now?
2015-02-01 11:37:10	+meskarune	just need to make the navigation mobile and it'll be good
2015-02-01 11:37:19	CalimeroTeknik	is there something really missing?

2015-02-01 11:39:11	fsckd	huzzah!
2015-02-01 11:39:49	+meskarune	CalimeroTeknik: I'd like to do somehthing different with upcoming events/calendar so its easier, but yeah I think it is :D
2015-02-01 11:40:22	CalimeroTeknik	ok, because I myself didn't actually know what to do for the site due to… the absence of a site stating what the project did
2015-02-01 11:40:26	CalimeroTeknik	or something like that :p
2015-02-01 11:40:39	+meskarune	oh also change donation a bit, but that is on the meeting I think
2015-02-01 11:41:03	fsckd	donation? it's not in the agenda...
2015-02-01 11:42:24	+meskarune	oh, I thought I added that a little whilte ago
2015-02-01 11:42:45	+tigrmesh	nice
2015-02-01 11:43:13	fsckd	meskarune: hmm, add it here https://pad.riseup.net/p/arch-women-meeting_-_February_2015 if you can?
2015-02-01 11:43:13	+meskarune	right now there is a paypal button, but lots of poeple don't like paypal and I wanted to explore other options
2015-02-01 11:43:14	phrik	Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
2015-02-01 11:43:34	+meskarune	we can talk about it last I guess :P
2015-02-01 11:43:38	+meskarune	sorry I"m derailing
2015-02-01 11:44:11	+tigrmesh	sorry.  looking at the site on my phone
2015-02-01 11:44:27	fsckd	meskarune: heh ok, i'll stick it on at the end?
2015-02-01 11:44:41	+meskarune	I think the padding/margins need to be tweaked on the box things tigrmesh, but at least they stack up :)
2015-02-01 11:45:07	+tigrmesh	they look good  :)
2015-02-01 11:46:07	fsckd	meskarune: what do i name the section in the meeting notes, "Website" or "Organization"?
2015-02-01 11:46:20	fsckd	nvm, someone beat me to it
2015-02-01 11:46:56	fsckd	where someone is you, lol
2015-02-01 11:47:00	+tigrmesh	community standards.  yay!
2015-02-01 11:47:37	+meskarune	hehe
2015-02-01 11:49:34	+tigrmesh	i'd like to change all the "rules" language for the irc link and page to "guidelines" would anyone have a problem with that?
2015-02-01 11:49:46	+tigrmesh	*irc channel links
2015-02-01 11:49:47	+meskarune	thats fine
2015-02-01 11:50:03	+tigrmesh	next up:  Arch Women has a mailing list again! Hosted by the wonderful Arch Linux.https://lists.archlinux.org/listinfo/arch-women
2015-02-01 11:50:03	phrik	Title: arch-women Info Page (at lists.archlinux.org)
2015-02-01 11:50:15	+meskarune	I need to make some guidelines for guest bloggers too
2015-02-01 11:50:26	+tigrmesh	good idea
2015-02-01 11:51:11	+tigrmesh	i'm not a mailing list person, not an email person at all.  
2015-02-01 11:51:40	fsckd	for those who don't know, Arch Linux is an investment firm specializing in taco futures
2015-02-01 11:51:47	+tigrmesh	but i'm glad we have one.  i know there are many email people
2015-02-01 11:51:53	+tigrmesh	hahs
2015-02-01 11:51:57	+tigrmesh	*haha
2015-02-01 11:53:40	+tigrmesh	so.  of course.  email people are probably not on irc...
2015-02-01 11:54:18	+tigrmesh	so if any of you are into email, please sign up and participate
2015-02-01 11:54:55	+tigrmesh	you know what i forgot to do?  i forgot to ping everyone
2015-02-01 11:55:50	+tigrmesh	because the next item is classroom, and halosghost is developing a class. 
2015-02-01 11:56:10	+tigrmesh	halosghost, are you around?
2015-02-01 11:57:09	+meskarune	the main advantage of a mailing list is having conversations with peole in different timezones
2015-02-01 11:57:15	+meskarune	so we don't have to be online at the same time
2015-02-01 11:57:34	+meskarune	also the slower pace may be easier for non-english speakers
2015-02-01 11:59:06	+tigrmesh	would it be ok to take a little break while i ping everyone?
2015-02-01 11:59:31	+meskarune	sure
2015-02-01 12:00:14	+tigrmesh	*deep breath*

2015-02-01 12:07:48	demize	tigrmesh: Nu-uh!
2015-02-01 12:08:00	demize	Well, technically it was “Tryant” I was called.
2015-02-01 12:08:15	demize	But I think I'm allowed to correct that typographical mistake.
2015-02-01 12:08:22	+tigrmesh	hehe
2015-02-01 12:08:26	fsckd	lol
2015-02-01 12:08:38	+tigrmesh	anyway.  back to the meeting.  
2015-02-01 12:08:44	+tigrmesh	meeting notes are at  https://pad.riseup.net/p/arch-women-meeting_-_February_2015
2015-02-01 12:08:45	phrik	Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
2015-02-01 12:09:03	GermainZ	Why is it highlighted in blue and purple?
2015-02-01 12:09:10	GermainZ	The blue part is slightly hard to read :(
2015-02-01 12:09:28	+tigrmesh	GermainZ, you have a color
2015-02-01 12:09:31	fsckd	sorry, the blue indicates i wrote it
2015-02-01 12:09:39	fsckd	the purple is meskarune
2015-02-01 12:09:48	GermainZ	ah
2015-02-01 12:09:58	+tigrmesh	everyone has a color.  i think if you click on the little person icon, you'll see yours
2015-02-01 12:10:09	GermainZ	Oh I can disable the colors
2015-02-01 12:10:13	fsckd	i changed my color, is it better?
2015-02-01 12:10:17	GermainZ	Gear icon > Authorship colors
2015-02-01 12:10:20	+tigrmesh	and if you hover over the text, you can see who wrote it
2015-02-01 12:10:21	GermainZ	Thanks fsckd :D
2015-02-01 12:13:12	+tigrmesh	and hh4a is not here to talk about his class
2015-02-01 12:13:26	GermainZ	now or not?
2015-02-01 12:13:30	GermainZ	oh, not.
2015-02-01 12:14:15	+tigrmesh	neither is halosghost .  does anyone have an opinion about developing classes in teams? 
2015-02-01 12:14:17	GermainZ	he hasn't logged in for a month
2015-02-01 12:14:20	GermainZ	(hh4a)
2015-02-01 12:14:25	+tigrmesh	dang
2015-02-01 12:14:50	+meskarune	might be busy with finals if they are in school
2015-02-01 12:14:56	+tigrmesh	yeah
2015-02-01 12:14:57	CalimeroTeknik	I was suggesting we could have a series of lightning talks
2015-02-01 12:15:03	GermainZ	a mailing list would be useful to send reminders :p
2015-02-01 12:15:18	+tigrmesh	we have one!
2015-02-01 12:15:26	+meskarune	CalimeroTeknik: "how to write bash scripts in 2 min"
2015-02-01 12:15:30	+tigrmesh	GermainZ,  https://lists.archlinux.org/listinfo/arch-women
2015-02-01 12:15:31	phrik	Title: arch-women Info Page (at lists.archlinux.org)
2015-02-01 12:15:38	CalimeroTeknik	meskarune, can do :p
2015-02-01 12:15:50	+meskarune	GermainZ: it's new though, so you didn't miss anything ;)
2015-02-01 12:15:56	GermainZ	:D
2015-02-01 12:18:44	+tigrmesh	ok.  so we're postponing the class discussion
2015-02-01 12:18:57	+tigrmesh	moving on.  mentorship
2015-02-01 12:19:05	+tigrmesh	is it too late to do GSoC?
2015-02-01 12:21:08	+tigrmesh	oh that's the next item.  might as well do that one and come back to mentorship
2015-02-01 12:21:50	+tigrmesh	so not only is there not much response on the mailing list, there's not much response here now
2015-02-01 12:21:57	GermainZ	:(
2015-02-01 12:22:01	fsckd	for internship that is
2015-02-01 12:22:21	fsckd	where mailist = -dev-public, not archwomen's
2015-02-01 12:22:23	+tigrmesh	to clarify for GSoC
2015-02-01 12:22:28	fsckd	mailing list*
2015-02-01 12:23:11	+tigrmesh	clarify:  for GSOC: There hasn't been a strong response on the mailing list, https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2014-November/026748.html
2015-02-01 12:23:11	phrik	Title: [arch-dev-public] GSoC 2015 (at lists.archlinux.org)
2015-02-01 12:25:27	+tigrmesh	i feel sad about that.  if i qualified for it, i would do it in a heartbeat
2015-02-01 12:25:56	+tigrmesh	i know there are lots of arch users who are students
2015-02-01 12:26:11	fsckd	yeah :(
2015-02-01 12:26:32	fsckd	it seems it gets proposed every now and then but not much comes out of it
2015-02-01 12:27:18	+tigrmesh	yeah
2015-02-01 12:28:24	+tigrmesh	anyone have any ideas about how to improve arch's chances of having someone?  ideas for next year?
2015-02-01 12:28:42	-->	pirithous (~pirithous@unaffiliated/pirithous) has joined #archlinux-women
2015-02-01 12:30:13	GermainZ	Do you have to be physically present for the GSoC?
2015-02-01 12:30:19	+tigrmesh	no
2015-02-01 12:31:36	fsckd	may be if we communicated that not all devs have to be mentors in GSoC. some are willing to. so get all the devs behind letting some of them be mentors?
2015-02-01 12:33:05	fsckd	but, so far i only know of Allan willing to be a mentor
2015-02-01 12:33:45	GermainZ	I have summer semesters :(
2015-02-01 12:34:10	+tigrmesh	GermainZ, you need to apply to google, there needs to be an open source project that mentors you, they need to have qualifying projects for you to apply for, there are requirements about how to stay in the loop - GSoC irc channel, blog about it
2015-02-01 12:34:35	GermainZ	yup, reading the FAQ
2015-02-01 12:34:41	+tigrmesh	ok
2015-02-01 12:34:45	+meskarune	I think the problem is there is a big time commitement 
2015-02-01 12:34:59	+meskarune	and the devs already are streched sorta thin with time
2015-02-01 12:35:09	GermainZ	yeah, I don't think it's possible with summer semesters for some students like me
2015-02-01 12:35:24	+meskarune	of course best way to address that is add more devs, but thats another can of worms lol
2015-02-01 12:36:04	+meskarune	but then again, participating in GSOC could be a way to gain more devs...
2015-02-01 12:36:14	+tigrmesh	GermainZ, what kind of summer semesters do you have?
2015-02-01 12:36:34	GermainZ	tigrmesh: it's like any other semester, but with ~half the course load
2015-02-01 12:36:56	+tigrmesh	do you have to do summer semesters?
2015-02-01 12:37:34	GermainZ	unless you want to be delayed, yes
2015-02-01 12:37:36	GermainZ	it might be mandatory -- I haven't actually checked
2015-02-01 12:37:58	<--	pirithous (~pirithous@unaffiliated/pirithous) has quit (Quit: Konversation terminated!)
2015-02-01 12:38:04	+tigrmesh	ahh.  ok
2015-02-01 12:39:30	+tigrmesh	so.  mentorship.  https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:mentorship:start
2015-02-01 12:39:31	phrik	Title: Mentorship Program [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
2015-02-01 12:40:13	+tigrmesh	ohh
2015-02-01 12:40:24	fsckd	for GSoC, i think it might be necessary to contact individual devs and discuss it with them on a one-to-one basis
2015-02-01 12:41:17	CalimeroTeknik	tigrmesh, I wrote that page, kind of… so if I got something wrong, please tell me
2015-02-01 12:41:37	+tigrmesh	!  live cd.  i'd like to do one for someone who helps me - to have a controlled environment for stuff for her machine at home
2015-02-01 12:42:01	CalimeroTeknik	well, if you look at the list, the link "mentorship offers"…
2015-02-01 12:42:02	+tigrmesh	CalimeroTeknik, no problem  :)
2015-02-01 12:42:18	+tigrmesh	i realized i need to ask you questions about that
2015-02-01 12:43:04	CalimeroTeknik	ok — I think the meeting takes priority right now
2015-02-01 12:43:55	CalimeroTeknik	maybe I'll spur discussion if I explain what/why I wrote this on the page linked just now
2015-02-01 12:44:18	CalimeroTeknik	I thought beginners needed to do stuff by themselves, mentors aren't teachers
2015-02-01 12:44:18	+tigrmesh	i know some stuff about excel formulas and pivot tables, quickbooks, and comparing data fed from one system to another.  but i doubt that's anything someone visiting arch women would be looking for
2015-02-01 12:44:40	+tigrmesh	CalimeroTeknik, please
2015-02-01 12:44:48	CalimeroTeknik	?
2015-02-01 12:44:53	CalimeroTeknik	who knows about that
2015-02-01 12:45:20	CalimeroTeknik	I suggest mentors would put up stuff they already know pretty well, so that answering on these matters will not be an effort for them
2015-02-01 12:45:30	thiagowfx	hello
2015-02-01 12:45:48	fsckd	hi thiagowfx :)
2015-02-01 12:45:52	+tigrmesh	sorry.  i'm getting confused because i was writing while you were responding
2015-02-01 12:46:16	+tigrmesh	would you please say more about "spur discussion if I explain what/why I wrote this on the page linked just now"?
2015-02-01 12:46:33	thiagowfx	I am slightly late :). Mind tl;dr what you were talking about?
2015-02-01 12:47:12	CalimeroTeknik	yes, I wrote that mentors are people who can answer questions to which a beginner has trouble finding answers
2015-02-01 12:47:27	CalimeroTeknik	implying not teachers who will take their hand and give all the material
2015-02-01 12:47:30	+tigrmesh	thiagowfx,  at this moment, we're on the mentorship item  https://pad.riseup.net/p/arch-women-meeting_-_February_2015
2015-02-01 12:47:31	phrik	Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
2015-02-01 12:48:26	+meskarune	thiagowfx: currently mentorship program :)
2015-02-01 12:48:36	+meskarune	oh tigrmesh beat me to it
2015-02-01 12:49:02	fsckd	thiagowfx: we went a little out of order and did internship first. i'll reorder that page in a moment :)
2015-02-01 12:49:44	+tigrmesh	CalimeroTeknik, sounds great to me
2015-02-01 12:49:54	fsckd	nvm, i forgot it crashes my browser when i try a cut&paste job ><
2015-02-01 12:50:53	thiagowfx	nice, I'm catching up. Thumbs up for the mailing list
2015-02-01 12:54:40	+tigrmesh	CalimeroTeknik, are you're trying to emphasize that it's not to be a teacher, but to be a resource?
2015-02-01 12:54:41	+meskarune	thanks thiagowfx :D
2015-02-01 12:55:30	+meskarune	tigrmesh: I think when we talked about it before, it was like, mentoring kids, you don't teach them how to to algebra, you help them with tips/tricks and help with things they are stuck on
2015-02-01 12:55:40	+tigrmesh	i think i just messed up the notes
2015-02-01 12:55:46	+tigrmesh	ahh
2015-02-01 12:55:56	CalimeroTeknik	tigrmesh, yes, we have classes for that anyway
2015-02-01 12:56:04	+meskarune	the little clock button lets you go back in time tigrmesh :)
2015-02-01 12:56:16	CalimeroTeknik	I'm all too used to the "newbie telling me to teach them" thing
2015-02-01 12:56:22	+tigrmesh	i found it.  whew!
2015-02-01 12:56:35	+tigrmesh	CalimeroTeknik, i understand now.  :)
2015-02-01 12:56:51	fsckd	we're all some shade of purple :P
2015-02-01 12:57:40	+tigrmesh	i'm more in green now.
2015-02-01 12:57:46	+tigrmesh	ok.  so.  
2015-02-01 12:58:08	--	Somasis_ is now known as Somasis
2015-02-01 12:58:10	fsckd	i'm more red now :)
2015-02-01 12:59:37	+tigrmesh	so there's a page you can add yourself to.  and a question about privacy
2015-02-01 13:00:04	+tigrmesh	i'm not sure what exactly that last line is
2015-02-01 13:00:18	+tigrmesh	sorry.
2015-02-01 13:00:28	+tigrmesh	we're on this item:  If you want to be available to mentor, add yourself to this page, https://archwomen.org/wiki/projects:mentorship:offers
2015-02-01 13:00:29	phrik	Title: Mentorship offers [Arch Women Wiki] (at archwomen.org)
2015-02-01 13:01:06	+tigrmesh	and we need more discussion on this, i think  Privacy for mentors on the list. Should the page be logged in members only?
2015-02-01 13:03:27	thiagowfx	tigrmesh: since this mentorship idea is new, I think it would be a good idea to begin this way, indeed (=page visible to members only)
2015-02-01 13:03:42	thiagowfx	as it progresses, we could reconsider its privacy
2015-02-01 13:03:50	jy2wong	nah, I think that makes the barrier to finding a mentor a bit too high
2015-02-01 13:04:47	jy2wong	IMO it should be really easy to determine 'is there someone mentoring something I'm interesed in'?
2015-02-01 13:05:33	+tigrmesh	what if we didn't give the nick, just the expertise, while making it clear what items belong to different people?
2015-02-01 13:05:57	jy2wong	yeah, I like that.
2015-02-01 13:07:00	fsckd	how do you find the nick then?
2015-02-01 13:07:23	jy2wong	send email or message channel op?
2015-02-01 13:07:29	+tigrmesh	finding the nick could be where you log in
2015-02-01 13:08:10	+tigrmesh	how would we separate by person without using "person a, person b"?
2015-02-01 13:08:22	fsckd	i don't think dokuwiki can do that can it? showing one page to logged in users and another page to non logged in users?
2015-02-01 13:08:42	thiagowfx	tigrmesh: public expertises and private nicks, yeah, sounds fine
2015-02-01 13:09:09	+tigrmesh	ok.  so contact an op or email archwomen
2015-02-01 13:10:29	+meskarune	I can make a new email group mentorship@archwomen.org
2015-02-01 13:10:41	+meskarune	so everyone in that group can access the mail
2015-02-01 13:10:47	+tigrmesh	nono
2015-02-01 13:10:54	+meskarune	lol
2015-02-01 13:10:55	+tigrmesh	too much work.  sorry
2015-02-01 13:11:03	+tigrmesh	just email you or ask here
2015-02-01 13:11:19	+tigrmesh	don't email me unless you want a response in glacial time
2015-02-01 13:11:50	 *	fsckd emails tigrmesh. get's reply after 3000 years :P
2015-02-01 13:12:24	CalimeroTeknik	hmm, is it really necessary to protect so much as IRC nicks?
2015-02-01 13:12:35	CalimeroTeknik	well, I got the point of course
2015-02-01 13:12:43	jy2wong	it occurs to me that the page history would tell you who added the 'anonymous' mentors
2015-02-01 13:13:32	+tigrmesh	yeah
2015-02-01 13:13:41	CalimeroTeknik	well, if we're going to go that far, yeah, you can be added by somebody, and that person can be the way to reach you
2015-02-01 13:13:50	CalimeroTeknik	as a filter
2015-02-01 13:14:15	CalimeroTeknik	instead of the IRC nick, we can put somebody to ask for "mentorship on that"
2015-02-01 13:14:17	Sarah	I have been summoned
2015-02-01 13:14:23	Sarah	IRC meeting, I guess
2015-02-01 13:14:25	fsckd	hmm... if we're doing this as a security thing... what are the ways someone can use this system to attack a mentor?
2015-02-01 13:14:26	+tigrmesh	hey Sarah !  yes
2015-02-01 13:14:33	fsckd	Sarah: just in time :)
2015-02-01 13:14:50	CalimeroTeknik	fsckd, scroll up for jy2wong's point
2015-02-01 13:15:22	+tigrmesh	what about asking an admin / someone else to add you?
2015-02-01 13:15:51	CalimeroTeknik	that's what I was suggesting
2015-02-01 13:15:55	fsckd	my point being, someone determined enough will get the nick of a mentor
2015-02-01 13:16:20	--	Sarah is now known as Aster
2015-02-01 13:16:20	CalimeroTeknik	yes but for that matter they need to contact the person who added them
2015-02-01 13:16:26	CalimeroTeknik	who is a different person
2015-02-01 13:16:35	CalimeroTeknik	if you need a proxy, here it is
2015-02-01 13:16:41	CalimeroTeknik	fsckd, <jy2wong>having second thoughts. While I'm happy to mentor, I'm not sure I'm happy having my name up on a...err, shit magnet page. >I really have no desire to have internet poo flung at me by random strangers who decide the arch women mentorship program is lulzy.
2015-02-01 13:17:19	fsckd	CalimeroTeknik: i understand that
2015-02-01 13:18:07	CalimeroTeknik	I myself don't care much and never get anything else than incredulous questions (people the existence of archwomen surprise)
2015-02-01 13:18:50	CalimeroTeknik	we do get some of these every once in a while on the channel, blurting "omg this actually exists"
2015-02-01 13:19:00	Aster	fsckd: just in time for..?
2015-02-01 13:19:07	CalimeroTeknik	the meeting
2015-02-01 13:19:08	+meskarune	fsckd: well, if you just have your nick listed, people can PM you and be harrassing
2015-02-01 13:19:34	+meskarune	and many people have their irc nick and social nick as the saem thing
2015-02-01 13:19:47	CalimeroTeknik	oh that's right
2015-02-01 13:19:53	thiagowfx	y
2015-02-01 13:20:04	fsckd	Aster: the meeting
2015-02-01 13:20:06	+meskarune	I get a ton of harrassment online for being female and being onling
2015-02-01 13:20:13	fsckd	(sorry had to go afk for a moment)
2015-02-01 13:20:23	+meskarune	but I don't mind dealing with that if other people don't have to
2015-02-01 13:20:37	Aster	I was at fosdem this weekend. Was anyone else in here attending?
2015-02-01 13:20:51	fsckd	meskarune: what i mean is, what protection can be provided? mentoring by proxy or creating huge barriers for mentees can be limiting to the program itself
2015-02-01 13:21:01	fsckd	meskarune: i want to avoid anti-patterns
2015-02-01 13:21:08	CalimeroTeknik	Aster, friends from archlinux.fr
2015-02-01 13:21:17	+meskarune	oh I mean just not having a list of people someone can send dick pics to :P
2015-02-01 13:21:23	fsckd	haha
2015-02-01 13:21:49	fsckd	one can just enter this channel and get a list of nicks :/
2015-02-01 13:21:56	jy2wong	yeah, that
2015-02-01 13:22:07	+meskarune	so a person can contact us, and say "I'm learning python and I"d like to have a mentor" and give us information about them and what they are looking for
2015-02-01 13:23:35	fsckd	ok, so that we can judge a potential mentee before connecting them to a mentor?
2015-02-01 13:23:53	Aster	mentee?
2015-02-01 13:24:00	+meskarune	fsckd: yeah, but having a list of people who are actively mentoring give them a target I guess
2015-02-01 13:24:05	thiagowfx	Aster: person who gets the mentoring
2015-02-01 13:24:10	Aster	manator and manatee
2015-02-01 13:24:14	+meskarune	hehe
2015-02-01 13:24:41	fsckd	Aster: mentees are the non-aquatic variety :P
2015-02-01 13:25:01	+meskarune	idk what the term is for person who is getting mentored :P
2015-02-01 13:25:07	Aster	speaking of tees, they ran out of t-shirts at fosdem :(
2015-02-01 13:25:30	+meskarune	aw
2015-02-01 13:25:34	fsckd	dictionary says mentee. we've been going with that
2015-02-01 13:25:48	thiagowfx	great

2015-02-01 13:26:04	Aster	meskarune: pupil? student? follower? 
2015-02-01 13:26:27	+meskarune	those work too :P
2015-02-01 13:27:09	+tigrmesh	no student or follower.  this is more like a resource
2015-02-01 13:27:33	CalimeroTeknik	that's a little bit over the top
2015-02-01 13:27:50	+tigrmesh	anyway back to the privacy thing.  it's important for me too
2015-02-01 13:28:10	CalimeroTeknik	everybody is people and some of them have ease in a certain field of expertise so other people can ask
2015-02-01 13:28:48	CalimeroTeknik	well, not some, everybody has something, though we focused on technical
2015-02-01 13:29:36	CalimeroTeknik	speaking of which, what should be the domain of the possibilities of mentoring?
2015-02-01 13:29:46	fsckd	i have to remmeber what my original concern was. i'm not against protecting mentors. there was something in particular i was concerned about...
2015-02-01 13:30:36	+meskarune	CalimeroTeknik: thats a good question, setting a scope for mentorship
2015-02-01 13:31:12	CalimeroTeknik	I put some language stuff in there myself
2015-02-01 13:32:32	+tigrmesh	wait.  we're getting sidetracked here.  jy2wong would you be ok with you and i and fsckd talking about this between now and the next meeting, and seeing if we can come up with a solution for this?
2015-02-01 13:33:05	+tigrmesh	*and anyone else who has concerns about mentor/mentee privacy?
2015-02-01 13:33:25	+tigrmesh	*mentoree
2015-02-01 13:33:37	fsckd	here it is. basically i was concerned with how far the barriers can go. so i want a proper description of what attacks we will be protecting against because we cannot protect against all attacks.
2015-02-01 13:34:40	-->	tuxampol (~Mylin@2001:a60:1199:d901:223:cdff:fec0:bb2f) has joined #archlinux-women
2015-02-01 13:34:46	jy2wong	tigrmesh: yeah, sure
2015-02-01 13:35:07	+tigrmesh	fsckd, would you be ok with you and i and jy2wong talking about this between now and the next meeting so we can be more specific?
2015-02-01 13:36:24	fsckd	go ahead
2015-02-01 13:36:44	+tigrmesh	i know i'm being selfish.  but i really want to be part of the discussion, and i need to focus on other stuff soon
2015-02-01 13:37:07	fsckd	i have to go afk at the moment and i am aware that many of you live in NA east and it is lunch time :)
2015-02-01 13:37:42	fsckd	sorry for dragging it on. i'm fine with continuing this in the next meeting after discussing more over the next month :)
2015-02-01 13:39:09	+tigrmesh	plus it's nearly 19:00 UTC.  i think
2015-02-01 13:39:25	fsckd	yeah, 18:39
2015-02-01 13:40:03	+tigrmesh	CalimeroTeknik, do you want to say more about your question:  "what should be the domain of the possibilities of mentoring?"
2015-02-01 13:40:12	+meskarune	ok, we'll have a mentor privacy meeting later on :)
2015-02-01 13:40:21	+meskarune	and we can discuss and take notes, etc
2015-02-01 13:40:46	CalimeroTeknik	tigrmesh, I have no idea as to the answer
2015-02-01 13:42:10	CalimeroTeknik	well, I wrote: The more Arch Linux users are good at doing what they like doing, the better the future contributions! 
2015-02-01 13:42:30	CalimeroTeknik	so I guess that kind of already says "stuff that's useful for Arch"
2015-02-01 13:43:18	CalimeroTeknik	but I don't feel like deciding for everybody, even though I somewhat did, in order to clarify things on the site
2015-02-01 13:43:36	+tigrmesh	right
2015-02-01 13:43:46	CalimeroTeknik	that's it for me
2015-02-01 13:44:34	+tigrmesh	so that leaves all my expertise out.  other than channel op stuff.  which can be pretty useful to arch, now that i think about it
2015-02-01 13:47:38	+tigrmesh	ok.  does anyone else have any suggestions to add?
2015-02-01 13:49:34	+tigrmesh	i know i'm scattered.  but i have someone expecting me soon.  
2015-02-01 13:49:39	thiagowfx	about privacy and mentoring or about mentoring itself?
2015-02-01 13:49:58	+tigrmesh	privacy will be later
2015-02-01 13:50:11	thiagowfx	okay
2015-02-01 13:50:19	+tigrmesh	mentoring and the domain of possible mentoring
2015-02-01 13:50:51	+tigrmesh	CalimeroTeknik, i like what you wrote about future contributions to arch  :)
2015-02-01 13:51:01	thiagowfx	I have an idea that is slightly related to mentoring, not sure if you tried anytime before
2015-02-01 13:51:09	+tigrmesh	oh?
2015-02-01 13:52:09	thiagowfx	using Google Hangouts (or any other platform, for that matter). It could be used for mentoring, for those monthly meetings, and this kind of stuff 
2015-02-01 13:52:27	thiagowfx	but I get the idea it is not something that everybody here would like
2015-02-01 13:55:49	+tigrmesh	it's an interesting idea, and i don't remember why we haven't done this before
2015-02-01 13:57:01	thiagowfx	Glad you like it. It would be nice if we could discuss it in the next meeting
2015-02-01 13:57:09	+tigrmesh	thiagowfx, awesome
2015-02-01 14:03:09	+meskarune	we could also use tox
2015-02-01 14:03:28	+meskarune	its like open source encrypted skype replacement
2015-02-01 14:03:57	+meskarune	but probably mentors can decide how they want to talk with the person they help
2015-02-01 14:06:16	+tigrmesh	i'm sorry.  i have to stop.  i can't fix the weird thing i wrote in the notes or anything.  meskarune could you finish up the meeting?
2015-02-01 14:06:23	+meskarune	sure :)
2015-02-01 14:10:02	+meskarune	ok, so any other comments on mentorship stuff?
2015-02-01 14:11:17	thiagowfx	I cannot open the tox homepage here for some reason :/

2015-02-01 14:13:28	+meskarune	https://www.filterbypass.me
2015-02-01 14:14:52	+meskarune	so the next item on the agenda, revamp donation stuff on the site and maybe make a plan to fund raise a bit
2015-02-01 14:15:00	+meskarune	right now we just have a paypal button
2015-02-01 14:15:24	+meskarune	but there are other payment gateways available as well as bitcoin
2015-02-01 14:16:05	+meskarune	I'd like to make a fund raising push as the domain needs to get renewed and I'm already in the hole quiet a bit with expenses
2015-02-01 14:16:48	+meskarune	does anyone have any preferences or opinions on donation or even sponsors?
2015-02-01 14:18:22	+meskarune	simple has a nice api but it's US only
2015-02-01 14:20:52	krosos	RDash has this fundraiser application running for his diasp.net… but it only works with paypal iirc
2015-02-01 14:21:19	+meskarune	oh cool krosos 
2015-02-01 14:21:33	krosos	it has an github link, one moment
2015-02-01 14:21:46	krosos	https://donate.diasp.net
2015-02-01 14:21:47	phrik	Title: Diasp.net / Donations (at donate.diasp.net)
2015-02-01 14:21:59	+meskarune	I just don't have a ton of experience with this and idk what people would prefer or find most secure
2015-02-01 14:22:01	krosos	the link can be found as an gh icon
2015-02-01 14:23:31	krosos	for this diasp.net keeping it online it was paypal via this fundraiser application, private donation and mostly paypal. i think bitcoin is doable but isn#t bitcoin on a steady downward course for some time now?
2015-02-01 14:24:15	+meskarune	https://github.com/gokercebeci/donateme
2015-02-01 14:24:16	phrik	Title: gokercebeci/donateme · GitHub (at github.com)
2015-02-01 14:24:18	+meskarune	I found it
2015-02-01 14:24:31	krosos	it is very difficult to find fundraiser application projects which are opensource and free, we found this one and i had the one which hambacherforst used last year.
2015-02-01 14:24:54	+meskarune	yeah, I was thinking to actually write something lol
2015-02-01 14:25:05	<--	thiagowfx (~thiagowfx@187.105.5.40) has quit (Quit: goodbye, ppl)
2015-02-01 14:25:12	+meskarune	but like having code to look at is helpful
2015-02-01 14:25:23	+meskarune	I may be able to use the same code for different payment gateways
2015-02-01 14:25:30	+meskarune	like simple and bitcoin
2015-02-01 14:25:44	+meskarune	thanks krosos 
2015-02-01 14:26:09	krosos	no problem :)
2015-02-01 14:26:12	+meskarune	so maybe I can make a donate.html page and like, pimp that out in social media
2015-02-01 14:26:14	<--	tuxampol (~Mylin@2001:a60:1199:d901:223:cdff:fec0:bb2f) has quit (Quit: Verlassend)
2015-02-01 14:26:15	krosos	i am interested in that as well
2015-02-01 14:26:33	+meskarune	if we get some donations it would cover ssl cert and domain name rewnewals, etc
2015-02-01 14:29:49	+meskarune	the other option is like, crowd funding type of thing

2015-02-01 14:36:38	krosos	bitcoin is sort of semi-private.

2015-02-01 14:39:28	krosos	i think "normal" donations, like setting up an bank account and people can donate there via international bank payment methods does not work that well without being an foundation or something?
2015-02-01 14:39:33	+meskarune	well I'll look into those options and see what I can put together ;)

2015-02-01 14:40:10	krosos	if you are interested in that post
2015-02-01 14:40:25	+meskarune	krosos: yeah, I'm not sure. right now the paypal link is just to my bank since I've been paying out of pocket for everything
2015-02-01 14:40:38	krosos	oh
2015-02-01 14:40:39	+meskarune	but I'd like to have AW with its own sepperate thing
2015-02-01 14:41:06	+meskarune	I don't have a lot of cash right now though
2015-02-01 14:41:13	+meskarune	so I really need to get in some donations
2015-02-01 14:41:22	+meskarune	so I can renew the domain :P
2015-02-01 14:42:43	+meskarune	ok, I guess we can move on to final comments
2015-02-01 14:42:51	krosos	i would look into the laws of your country concerning this. i don't even know how others operate in that case, I just know with my status I can not accept incoming money (well i do, but it is breaking some regulation I have with my curent status, so if someone ever checks the bankaccount logs of the last 3 months again I have a problem)
2015-02-01 14:43:01	krosos	okay
2015-02-01 14:43:24	+meskarune	oh, in the US you don't even have to report small amounts of money
2015-02-01 14:43:41	+meskarune	like I think below $200 or something
2015-02-01 14:43:56	krosos	right, different system when you are unemployed in the US.
2015-02-01 14:44:21	+meskarune	and reporting is just for like, tax purposes
2015-02-01 14:44:38	+meskarune	to get money tax free we'd have to apply as a non-profit
2015-02-01 14:44:42	+meskarune	but that is complicated
2015-02-01 14:45:02	krosos	ah, i thought that was easy as so many of these exist
2015-02-01 14:45:05	+meskarune	you need to have a board and rules and assign jobs and stuff
2015-02-01 14:45:20	fsckd	regarding the idea of using Google Hangouts or something else as a place to have meetings. it would need to have the ability to log and reply the meeting for people who couldn't attend. it should also be accessible to hard of hearing and visually impaired folks
2015-02-01 14:45:22	krosos	i see
2015-02-01 14:45:50	fsckd	(sorry for interrupting. i just wanted to through that out there before the meeting ends)
2015-02-01 14:46:19	+meskarune	yeah I agree fsckd 
2015-02-01 14:46:41	+meskarune	I think mentoring is fine over that if people want to do that, but we don't need to require it
2015-02-01 14:47:01	fsckd	yeah. mentorship stuff are private discussions
2015-02-01 14:47:04	+meskarune	people would just decide how they want to interact
2015-02-01 14:47:36	fsckd	throw*
2015-02-01 14:48:53	fsckd	meetings are public discussions which involve lots of people. similarly for classrooms.
2015-02-01 14:53:37	+meskarune	oh, so apparently donations are considered gifts in that the person does not recieve anything in return, and gifts are not taxed if they go to charitable or politica causes as long as its less than $14,000
2015-02-01 14:54:03	+meskarune	my goal was going to be like, $50 lol
2015-02-01 14:54:19	+meskarune	so I think on all fronts it won't be a problem
2015-02-01 14:55:29	+meskarune	fsckd: I think meetings on irc is fine
2015-02-01 14:55:57	+meskarune	maybe we should have a more prominent link to a web irc client on teh home page
2015-02-01 14:56:12	+meskarune	like "come join us on irc! <link to kiwiirc>"
2015-02-01 14:58:46	fsckd	that sounds good :)
2015-02-01 15:05:02	+meskarune	ok, any other comments/concerns/suggestions?
2015-02-01 15:09:03	+meskarune	kk I guess I'll end the meeting :P

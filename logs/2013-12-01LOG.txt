Dec 01 12:24:43 <tigrmesh>	so if someone PMs you and says "i can't talk in arch women", you can explain why.  and can tell them how to be able to
Dec 01 12:25:50 <tigrmesh>	and if someone comes in who's clearly a troll, let a mod know.  find mods by doing   /msg chanserv access #archlinux-women list

Dec 01 12:27:53 *	fsckd doesn't know how
Dec 01 12:27:58 <meskarune>	you can pm him and play with all the commands without spamming the channel
Dec 01 12:28:04 <meskarune>	do /query phrik
Dec 01 12:28:08 <fsckd>	oh that, lol

Dec 01 12:41:51 <meskarune>	so server stuff
Dec 01 12:42:04 <meskarune>	need to get munin finished up, and just keep an eye on bandwidth
Dec 01 12:42:12 <meskarune>	if it uses too much, we could have it update less often
Dec 01 12:42:18 <meskarune>	crap, offline again
Dec 01 12:43:41 <meskarune>	back
Dec 01 12:43:54 <fsckd>	yikes
Dec 01 12:43:58 <meskarune>	ok, so monitoring needs to get setup, and then we can check for server issues
Dec 01 12:44:12 <meskarune>	munin is installed, but I have to play with the configure and do some tests for bandwidth usage
Dec 01 12:44:16 <meskarune>	hopefully its not too much

Dec 01 12:54:44 <meskarune>	oh cool

Dec 01 12:57:34 <CalimeroTeknik>	the basic one yeah, probably. it's modular so I'll add modules
Dec 01 12:57:46 <meskarune>	should it be eariler?
Dec 01 12:57:48 <meskarune>	idk
Dec 01 12:57:50 <meskarune>	><
Dec 01 12:57:57 <meskarune>	maybe people will be travling?
Dec 01 12:59:25 <fsckd>	it is a Friday
Dec 01 13:00:09 <meskarune>	oooh kk. idk what a good day would be
Dec 01 13:00:49 <CalimeroTeknik>	in France we generally do that on saturdays (when it's an exceptional event, on sundays)
Dec 01 13:01:10 <CalimeroTeknik>	people work monday through friday
Dec 01 13:04:03 <meskarune>	ok
Dec 01 13:04:34 <meskarune>	21st? or do the week before on the 14th?
Dec 01 13:05:12 <fsckd>	14th is trailing end of finals
Dec 01 13:05:47 <fsckd>	i say 21st or 28th
Dec 01 13:06:46 <fsckd>	err 14th is middle of finals, depending on the school of course
Dec 01 13:13:32 <meskarune>	28th is after the main holiday, but people should still have time off
Dec 01 13:13:36 <meskarune>	before new years
Dec 01 13:13:40 <meskarune>	so that might be a good date
Dec 01 13:19:26 <tigrmesh>	before we decide, does anyone besides the 4 of us (me, CalimeroTeknik, fsckd and meskarune have an opinion)?
Dec 01 13:19:46 <tigrmesh>	we can't speak for anyone but ourselves
Dec 01 13:19:51 <tigrmesh>	CalimeroTeknik, are you in school?
Dec 01 13:23:24 <meskarune>	I guess not
Dec 01 13:23:32 <meskarune>	ugh, I hate my internet connection. It does this all day
Dec 01 13:29:24 <tigrmesh>	vodik, jy2wong and terra-and-luna are in shcool.  Aster too.  we're thinking of doing an install day the saturday between Christmas and New Year's.  dec 29.  any opinion about whether that's good or bad for students?
Dec 01 13:30:58 <tigrmesh>	we could do a new year's day: New Year, New Arch Install" install day.  but we'd get very few people, most of whom would be hung over or overtired from staying up late
Dec 01 13:31:13 <tigrmesh>	"New Year, New Arch Install"
Dec 01 13:32:42 <fsckd>	i like that as the slogan, even if it's on 28th or 29th
Dec 01 13:33:58 <meskarune>	outsourcing the question to offtopic
Dec 01 13:34:10 <meskarune>	I'm sure someone will answer after a few jokes and trolls
Dec 01 13:34:22 <meskarune>	I like that tigrmesh :)
Dec 01 13:34:32 <tigrmesh>	haha
Dec 01 13:35:53 <meskarune>	people are saying 14th in the afternoon

Dec 01 13:49:34 <meskarune>	14th is in 2 weeks
Dec 01 13:49:39 <meskarune>	is that enough time?
Dec 01 13:49:44 <meskarune>	if not, then 28th is probably good
Dec 01 13:50:24 <vodik>	14th im at work, 28th im on vacation
Dec 01 13:50:43 <vodik>	so both won't work for me
Dec 01 13:52:08 <jy2wong>	tigrmesh: Dec 29 sounds reasonable, other than the fact that *because* there is no school, people are on vacation somewhere :P
Dec 01 13:52:40 <CalimeroTeknik>	tigrmesh, I am in engineer school yeah, no courses during the week-end
Dec 01 13:53:26 <jy2wong>	exam period is more reasonable of a time for $event than you'd think
Dec 01 13:53:52 <CalimeroTeknik>	I'm in vacation 21st through 5th january
Dec 01 13:54:20 <tigrmesh>	will that be enough time, and what do we want to do to publicize it?

Dec 01 14:15:21 *	kristof (~kristof@unaffiliated/kristof) has joined #archlinux-women
Dec 01 14:15:29 <tigrmesh>	i'll research which linuxchix and arch announce lists would be right, and post the announcements there
Dec 01 14:17:50 <meskarune>	ok awesome
Dec 01 14:18:05 <meskarune>	and last thing is call for blog posts :)
Dec 01 14:18:11 <meskarune>	I really got to get on some of mine
Dec 01 14:18:20 <meskarune>	and add the blog rss to the home page so people can see what's up
Dec 01 14:20:24 <meskarune>	but I can ask again when people are about
Dec 01 14:20:43 <meskarune>	anything else we need to discuss?
Dec 01 14:20:45 <meskarune>	:)
Dec 01 14:23:04 <tigrmesh>	also, would anyone be willing to quickly write up link items when asked?
Dec 01 14:23:29 <tigrmesh>	it takes me forever to write stuff, so they don't get posted
Dec 01 14:25:24 <tigrmesh>	just like "ada lovelace day will be [date]. ada lovelace was [about 1 sentence].  and was really cool and relevant to arch women because [about 1 sentence]."
Dec 01 14:25:33 <tigrmesh>	?  please?
Dec 01 14:30:29 <tigrmesh>	also, any events or links that you find, or thoughts that you have about:
Dec 01 14:31:00 *	vodik has quit (Quit: moving)
Dec 01 14:31:05 <tigrmesh>	being a woman in tech classes [for women only]
Dec 01 14:31:17 <meskarune>	the submission page should help make it easier to create the post format, but I need to automate blog updates more so its easier
Dec 01 14:31:38 <tigrmesh>	for both genders:  being in tech classes (or other tech spaces) with women
Dec 01 14:31:53 <tigrmesh>	that doesn't matter for now
Dec 01 14:32:01 <tigrmesh>	if you write a post, we'll get it on there
Dec 01 14:32:06 <tigrmesh>	no worries about that part
Dec 01 14:32:37 *	vodik (~root@archlinux/op/vodik) has joined #archlinux-women
Dec 01 14:33:10 <tigrmesh>	sorry, meskarune.  of course it matters.  just trying to say there's no need to wait for the automated posting if you have something to say  :)
Dec 01 14:33:28 <tigrmesh>	*if someone has something they want to put on the site
Dec 01 14:33:39 <meskarune>	<3 I know what you mean :D
Dec 01 14:33:41 <meskarune>	no worries
Dec 01 14:34:04 <meskarune>	I think I could have a git hook that runs the blog update script
Dec 01 14:34:11 <meskarune>	so we can just git push and bam blog updates
Dec 01 14:35:50 <meskarune>	then I can have the submission script email us when there is a new post
Dec 01 14:36:05 <meskarune>	or maybe ping the channel or something idk
Dec 01 14:36:12 <meskarune>	whatever will work best for us
Dec 01 14:36:26 <fsckd>	:)
Dec 01 14:39:10 <tigrmesh>	any other comments or questions?
Dec 01 14:43:32 <tigrmesh>	anyone?
Dec 01 14:44:23 <fsckd>	i guess it is time to end the meeting
Dec 01 14:45:50 <meskarune>	==== Meeting Ended ====

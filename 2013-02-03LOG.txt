2013-02-03 11:14:25        phrik   Title: TitanPad: QCjfMjRuoP (at titanpad.com)
2013-02-03 11:14:41   +meskarune   \o/
2013-02-03 11:14:56        fsckd   xrchz: the floor is yours, start again :)
2013-02-03 11:15:10        xrchz   1st item is a review of what has happened
2013-02-03 11:15:34   +meskarune   so tons of optimization so we get the most bang for our buck
2013-02-03 11:15:49        xrchz   this is for the archwomen.org website?
2013-02-03 11:15:50   +meskarune   the server is still under constant hack attempts though
2013-02-03 11:16:01   +meskarune   so we have to continue to increase security
2013-02-03 11:16:04        fsckd   xrchz: yes
2013-02-03 11:16:08         hh4a   thats lame, someone has a secret agenda against us
2013-02-03 11:16:23   +meskarune   hh4a: last time it was the syrian electronic army 
2013-02-03 11:16:27         hh4a   We need to deploy T800s
2013-02-03 11:16:27   +meskarune   its probably still them
2013-02-03 11:16:31   +meskarune   haha
2013-02-03 11:16:32        xrchz   yes that is strange - can we get any clues from logs as to who?
2013-02-03 11:17:14        xrchz   presumably we run arch linux though so maintaining high security is not as painful as it could be
2013-02-03 11:17:23   +meskarune   they have been making hits on random urls like /join.php /wp-login.php and /admin.php (right now we just have static files for hte most part)
2013-02-03 11:17:29   +meskarune   xrchz: YES ++
2013-02-03 11:17:30        fsckd   the attacks are automated and may be through a botnet
2013-02-03 11:18:08        fsckd   there are also the usual attempts on ssh
2013-02-03 11:18:09        xrchz   is there a way to coordinate security tasks in redmine or something?
2013-02-03 11:18:27        fsckd   meskarune: i reiterate the proposal for using an alt port
2013-02-03 11:18:29   +meskarune   thats a good idea
2013-02-03 11:18:41        xrchz   do we have dedicated web people or is it just anyone who volunteers? (could be both...)
2013-02-03 11:19:01        xrchz   for ssh, public-key only should be enough
2013-02-03 11:19:03   +meskarune   site is a vps atm
2013-02-03 11:19:17        xrchz   for http(s) i guess it depends a bit on the server - what is our server..
2013-02-03 11:19:26   +meskarune   xrchz: its public key only, and allowedusers = server staff
2013-02-03 11:19:29        fsckd   xrchz: i don't like seeing them in the log >< but yeah, public keys should be enough
2013-02-03 11:19:31   +meskarune   also logins are limited
2013-02-03 11:19:44   +meskarune   logs can be useful if we have to firewall people :)
2013-02-03 11:19:56   +meskarune   but if journald starts using too much ram, we can 
2013-02-03 11:20:32        xrchz   the main hole is going to be the web server though, right? nothing else..?
2013-02-03 11:20:40   +meskarune   xrchz: yeah, I believe so
2013-02-03 11:20:56   +meskarune   we have mail hosted with zoho, which also have a text editer, calendar, groups, etc
2013-02-03 11:20:57        xrchz   are we using a particularly vulnerable one?
2013-02-03 11:21:05   +meskarune   we want to get more people on there as well
2013-02-03 11:21:25   +meskarune   xrchz: right now its all static files, except redmine, which needs to be updated asap
2013-02-03 11:21:30   +meskarune   there was a ruby on rails security issue
2013-02-03 11:21:59   +meskarune   xrchz: we are going to configure a python based blog for the new site
2013-02-03 11:22:12   +meskarune   python and java are more secure than php apps
2013-02-03 11:22:19   +meskarune   as crazy as that sounds
2013-02-03 11:22:46         hh4a   its not crazy
2013-02-03 11:23:15        xrchz   so is it feasible to use redmine to list the stuff we want to do with the server and assign it to people etc.?
2013-02-03 11:23:22   +meskarune   yep :)
2013-02-03 11:23:23        xrchz   and who can take the first step with that?
2013-02-03 11:23:31        xrchz   e.g. create a task on redmine for something
2013-02-03 11:23:36   +meskarune   I think anyone can make projecst and tasks
2013-02-03 11:23:46        xrchz   let me put it tihs way: who is going to ? :P
2013-02-03 11:23:47   +meskarune   also bugs/feature requests/etc
2013-02-03 11:23:57   +meskarune   as many people as we can recruit :)
2013-02-03 11:24:04        fsckd   sign up for redmine please :)
2013-02-03 11:24:06   +meskarune   we need to audit the skills we have available here
2013-02-03 11:24:15         hh4a   iam just an ant, a conscript, a shuffelier
2013-02-03 11:24:23   +meskarune   like who knows web stuff, who knows dev, coding, admin, etc
2013-02-03 11:24:26    *   Sarah pulls out the magnifying glass
2013-02-03 11:24:28        xrchz   right
2013-02-03 11:24:28   +meskarune   haha hh4a 
2013-02-03 11:24:34    *   fsckd gives hh4a a hat and a rifle
2013-02-03 11:24:40   +meskarune   and who is good at writing
2013-02-03 11:24:45   +meskarune   ^ important skill
2013-02-03 11:25:03        xrchz   that might come into agenda item (2)
2013-02-03 11:25:09        fsckd   yeah
2013-02-03 11:25:10         hh4a   There should be some pool bout that
2013-02-03 11:25:27        xrchz   for (1) should we just say we're going to start coordinating better, and move all the ideas that came up into tasks?
2013-02-03 11:25:39        xrchz   I've been trying to get them down on the titanpad
2013-02-03 11:27:16   +meskarune   <3
2013-02-03 11:27:33        xrchz   If so, then let's move on to (2)
2013-02-03 11:27:52   +meskarune   basically we've made it nearly a year, and grown, so time to -Syu
2013-02-03 11:27:55        xrchz   setting up groups, spreading tasks. probably should start with the skills audit and also a list of what tasks need doing.
2013-02-03 11:28:26        fsckd   last meeting we decided to use groups and let each project have their own meetings
2013-02-03 11:28:27   +meskarune   I want people to add tasks as they think of them :)
2013-02-03 11:28:37   +meskarune   anyone and everyone
2013-02-03 11:28:48        fsckd   that ^
2013-02-03 11:29:13        xrchz   so we add them on redmine, presumably? need an account?
2013-02-03 11:29:25        fsckd   yup
2013-02-03 11:29:38        xrchz   everyone here should probably get one if they don't have one then :)
2013-02-03 11:30:03   +meskarune   http://redmine.archwomen.org
2013-02-03 11:30:05        phrik   Title: Arch Linux Women: Project Manager (at redmine.archwomen.org)
2013-02-03 11:30:21        xrchz   sigh why is this also not https :(
2013-02-03 11:30:39   +meskarune   I know :(
2013-02-03 11:30:43   +meskarune   I'm working on the ssl cert
2013-02-03 11:30:48        fsckd   that's also on todo
2013-02-03 11:31:00   +meskarune   I signed up to startssl
2013-02-03 11:31:27        xrchz   meskarune: awesome
2013-02-03 11:32:23   +meskarune   namecheap has ssl certs for $7.95 a year
2013-02-03 11:32:40        xrchz   the free startssl one should be fine - we don't have subdomains
2013-02-03 11:32:41        Sarah   Registered.
2013-02-03 11:32:50        fsckd   xrchz: we do
2013-02-03 11:32:51        xrchz   yet...
2013-02-03 11:32:54        xrchz   hmm
2013-02-03 11:32:59        fsckd   redmine.archwomen.org
2013-02-03 11:33:02        xrchz   right
2013-02-03 11:33:06        fsckd   and archwomen.org
2013-02-03 11:33:09        xrchz   how much is the cheapest startcom one?
2013-02-03 11:34:00   +meskarune   its free, but I keep running into issues with it
2013-02-03 11:34:02   +meskarune   :/
2013-02-03 11:34:09        xrchz   no, the cheapest one that allows subdomains
2013-02-03 11:34:15   +meskarune   oooh
2013-02-03 11:34:27        xrchz   since it may be better to switch to another provider 
2013-02-03 11:34:34        xrchz   since we're going to have to pay anyway
2013-02-03 11:34:40   +meskarune   wildcard ssl are expensive
2013-02-03 11:34:45        fsckd   who will pay?
2013-02-03 11:34:56        xrchz   does this project have a budget?
2013-02-03 11:35:05        xrchz   does it take donations?
2013-02-03 11:35:13   +meskarune   we do!
2013-02-03 11:35:27   +meskarune   right now we don't have a budget
2013-02-03 11:35:27        xrchz   to the latter, I suppose
2013-02-03 11:35:35   +meskarune   we need to make one
2013-02-03 11:35:35        xrchz   right. probably need a budget and a treasurer :P
2013-02-03 11:35:45   +meskarune   and fund raise for stuff
2013-02-03 11:35:52     Nahlidge   I'll add twelve frost bluberry poptarts to the budget.
2013-02-03 11:35:58   +meskarune   like if we wanted to send a woman speaker to an event
2013-02-03 11:36:04   +meskarune   hehe Nahlidge 
2013-02-03 11:36:10   +meskarune   domain name is $10 a year
2013-02-03 11:36:19   +meskarune   hosting is free atm
2013-02-03 11:36:28        fsckd   should archwomen be registered as a non-profit? that can help with donations
2013-02-03 11:36:39         hh4a   i can share some wood
2013-02-03 11:36:40   +meskarune   it couldn
2013-02-03 11:36:47   +meskarune   it coudln't hurt
2013-02-03 11:36:59   +meskarune   and it can help with discounts on things
2013-02-03 11:37:03        xrchz   indeed.
2013-02-03 11:37:10        xrchz   getting back to skills audit and task lists...
2013-02-03 11:37:12   +meskarune   but applying for non-profit status is a little complicated
2013-02-03 11:37:16   +meskarune   you have to have a board
2013-02-03 11:37:22   +meskarune   and get grants, etc
2013-02-03 11:37:22        xrchz   I think the task list stuff is sorted out by just using redimne (i signed up...)
2013-02-03 11:37:29        xrchz   what about skills audit?
2013-02-03 11:38:40         ioni   meskarune, wilcard from starssl is quite cheap. 60$/2years
2013-02-03 11:39:18        Sarah   Or you can go with CACert or something.
2013-02-03 11:39:32         ioni   cacert is not accepted by most of the browsers
2013-02-03 11:39:35     sudokode   ioni: screw it, just do grouping
2013-02-03 11:39:43     sudokode   you can at least get it to firefox users
2013-02-03 11:40:08     fogobogo   "redmine.archwomen.org - your monthly occupation"
2013-02-03 11:40:16     sudokode   (www|foo|bar|baz).domain.com
2013-02-03 11:40:16        fsckd   i thought mozilla rejected cacert?
2013-02-03 11:40:28   +meskarune   ioni: oh wow, yeah that is
2013-02-03 11:40:39   +meskarune   most of them are like $100+ per year
2013-02-03 11:40:48         ioni   sudokode, is not accepted even by mozilla
2013-02-03 11:40:52        xrchz   Figuring out the best option for SSL can be done outside meeting, no?
2013-02-03 11:40:55     sudokode   used to be
2013-02-03 11:40:55         ioni   we used to include it because we patched nss
2013-02-03 11:41:05     sudokode   haha
2013-02-03 11:41:15         ioni   xrchz, sorry about that
2013-02-03 11:41:17         ioni   carry on
2013-02-03 11:41:20     sudokode   that was a great exploit
2013-02-03 11:41:23   +meskarune   thats interesting though :)
2013-02-03 11:41:29        xrchz   next thing is skills audit - do we want one, and how can we do one?
2013-02-03 11:41:38        xrchz   because it could help assigning people to tasks
2013-02-03 11:41:41        fsckd   wait wait
2013-02-03 11:41:43   +meskarune   we can have people list their skills on their profile
2013-02-03 11:41:44        xrchz   but... maybe it's better to just get volunteering?
2013-02-03 11:41:55        xrchz   there are profiles? i need to look at this redmine thing hey...
2013-02-03 11:42:07        fsckd   nvm i got confused, carry on... as you are doing
2013-02-03 11:42:33   +meskarune   well, we can make a users group, and update the wiki
2013-02-03 11:42:52        xrchz   good idea
2013-02-03 11:43:00   +meskarune   but yeah, I think people can assign them selves things aslo
2013-02-03 11:43:03   +meskarune   also
2013-02-03 11:43:07   +meskarune   we just have to have a list of things to do
2013-02-03 11:43:17        xrchz   so profiles on wiki?
2013-02-03 11:43:55     sudokode   what do you want me to do
2013-02-03 11:44:00        xrchz   I think we're about done with item (2). Fix http://titanpad.com/QCjfMjRuoP as necessary. Let's move on to (3).
2013-02-03 11:44:01        phrik   Title: TitanPad: QCjfMjRuoP (at titanpad.com)
2013-02-03 11:44:10        xrchz   sudokode: we'll coordinate all tasks through redmine.archwomen.org
2013-02-03 11:44:25        xrchz   (3) is Channel Rules
2013-02-03 11:44:27     sudokode   coordination.. booooring
2013-02-03 11:44:35        fsckd   wait wait, not done with groups
2013-02-03 11:44:55        xrchz   fsckd: sorry - go ahead..
2013-02-03 11:44:56        fsckd   we need to address the propasal accepted at the last meeting
2013-02-03 11:45:10     sudokode   oh is this one of them fancy meetings. sorry, I'll be quiet now
2013-02-03 11:45:21        fsckd   but first, everyone who just signed up on redmine, your accounts are accepted
2013-02-03 11:45:27        xrchz   excellent
2013-02-03 11:45:34         hh4a   sudokode: dont be quiet, elaborate!
2013-02-03 11:45:49     sudokode   hh4a: my ideas generally involve ponies and ice cream
2013-02-03 11:45:54        fsckd   also, you don't need to enter your real names. you can remove them if you want
2013-02-03 11:46:10        fsckd   one todo item is to get redmine to stop asking for them
2013-02-03 11:46:35        fsckd   ok
2013-02-03 11:46:51        xrchz   I'll add that
2013-02-03 11:46:56        fsckd   last time we said we'd have each project as its own group
2013-02-03 11:47:03        fsckd   with their own meetings
2013-02-03 11:47:32        fsckd   we need to designate project coordinators
2013-02-03 11:47:48        fsckd   who will serve as the go to people for their respective projects
2013-02-03 11:48:02        fsckd   (in irc, no idea what to do with them on redmine)
2013-02-03 11:48:12        fsckd   (ideas are welcome though)
2013-02-03 11:48:43        xrchz   can that go on the wiki profiles?
2013-02-03 11:49:24        fsckd   yeah
2013-02-03 11:49:43         Mion   http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/IMG_2649.JPG
2013-02-03 11:49:46         Mion   http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/IMG_2650.JPG
2013-02-03 11:50:03        fsckd   the projects we have currently are classrooms, internship and install day
2013-02-03 11:50:56        xrchz   I also see  mailing list, marketing, website, and server admin
2013-02-03 11:51:36        xrchz   where is the wiki?
2013-02-03 11:51:39        fsckd   for now i think meskarune and tigrmesh head server admin and website?
2013-02-03 11:51:49        fsckd   xrchz: each project has its own wiki
2013-02-03 11:52:07        fsckd   there should be a wiki tab if you click on a project
2013-02-03 11:52:18        xrchz   meskarune: tigrmesh: want to list yourselves as project coordinators for those then, in the respective wikis?
2013-02-03 11:53:24        xrchz   volunteers for the other projects go ahead and do the same
2013-02-03 11:54:15        xrchz   we might need a project that can deal with things like making us a non-profit and handling the finances
2013-02-03 11:54:50        fsckd   good idea
2013-02-03 11:55:21        fsckd   tigrmesh propsed an archwomen project area in redmine for archwomen stuff
2013-02-03 11:55:33        xrchz   right
2013-02-03 11:55:50        xrchz   fsckd: can you make that project? (I don't see how to make new ones)
2013-02-03 11:56:02        fsckd   really? you should have the ability
2013-02-03 11:56:49        fsckd   on the projects page at the top is something like "New project | View all issues | Overall spent time | Overall activity"
2013-02-03 11:56:58        fsckd   do you see that ^ ?
2013-02-03 11:57:47        xrchz   I see all but the first item
2013-02-03 11:58:09        fsckd   dang... that needs to be fixed, thnaks for pointing it out
2013-02-03 11:58:59        fsckd   i don't know how permissions work (i'm not the main admin, tigrmesh is), so this'll be fixed a little later
2013-02-03 11:59:03        xrchz   sure
2013-02-03 11:59:10        xrchz   in the meantime can you creat the archwomen project?
2013-02-03 11:59:25        fsckd   sure
2013-02-03 11:59:43   +meskarune   I need to read up on redmine permissions as well :)
2013-02-03 11:59:54        xrchz   and, are we done with the groups item now? we basically just need people to volunteer to coordinate the individual projects ,and advertise themselves as such on the project wikis (and here).
2013-02-03 11:59:59   +meskarune   I bet we could steal the redmine docs and stick them on our stuff
2013-02-03 12:00:10   +meskarune   xrchz: yes :D
2013-02-03 12:00:50        xrchz   next up is Channel Rules.
2013-02-03 12:00:56        xrchz   I notice we don't have an IRC project either...
2013-02-03 12:00:59    gtmanfred   KaiSforza: wat?
2013-02-03 12:01:07        xrchz   but maybe we don't need an entire project just to write down the rules
2013-02-03 12:01:22        xrchz   have they been written already?
2013-02-03 12:01:45        xrchz   currently we link to freenode/archlinux-offtopic policies
2013-02-03 12:02:24   +meskarune   xrchz: oh we should def have irc on there :)
2013-02-03 12:02:30    KaiSforza   gtmanfred: how did you know i was back on?
2013-02-03 12:02:31   +meskarune   you're on a roll
2013-02-03 12:03:08    gtmanfred   wait, has the meeting started
2013-02-03 12:03:10    gtmanfred   ?
2013-02-03 12:03:14        fsckd   an hour ago
2013-02-03 12:03:24        xrchz   meskarune: in that case, someone with the permissions should set up an irc project or subproject on redmine
2013-02-03 12:03:32    KaiSforza   gtmanfred: no, they're just talking about meeting stuff.
2013-02-03 12:03:53        xrchz   and make a task to write the channel rules, or publish them,  - or just do it

2013-02-03 12:05:59        xrchz   anyone have anything to contribute re channel rules?
2013-02-03 12:06:16   +meskarune   can of worms. have people add stuff in redmine :)
2013-02-03 12:06:21   +meskarune   or we'll here all day lol
2013-02-03 12:06:25        fsckd   haha
2013-02-03 12:07:02   +meskarune   all suggestions welcome, just create feature requests, add to wiki, etc
2013-02-03 12:07:03      qubodup   sorry for being late, as expected
2013-02-03 12:07:08   +meskarune   <3
2013-02-03 12:07:09        xrchz   ok.
2013-02-03 12:07:16        xrchz   will need that irc project/subprojcet then.
2013-02-03 12:07:31        xrchz   let's move on to (4)
2013-02-03 12:08:09        xrchz   4 is Men of ArchLinux Calendar
2013-02-03 12:08:29   +meskarune   qubodup: you're just in time ;D
2013-02-03 12:08:30    *   fsckd snickers
2013-02-03 12:08:36        fsckd   hi qubodup :)
2013-02-03 12:09:22      qubodup   I see
2013-02-03 12:09:28   +meskarune   haha
2013-02-03 12:09:42        xrchz   notes are here http://titanpad.com/QCjfMjRuoP for what you missed
2013-02-03 12:09:43        phrik   Title: TitanPad: QCjfMjRuoP (at titanpad.com)
2013-02-03 12:09:45      qubodup   allright, let me get the camera...
2013-02-03 12:09:49      qubodup   xrchz: thx
2013-02-03 12:09:56        xrchz   also it seems like the main theme of the meeting is: get everyone using redmine and doing tasks on it
2013-02-03 12:10:04        xrchz   someone put that in the channel topic and on the website front page
2013-02-03 12:10:18        fsckd   very astute, good idea
2013-02-03 12:10:20   +meskarune   yep, lets get lots of data, we need wiki updates, procject ideas, feature requests, etc
2013-02-03 12:10:22   +meskarune   and volunteers
2013-02-03 12:10:30        fsckd   and a twitter post
2013-02-03 12:10:55    *   qubodup whispers "and as little infrastructure as possible."
2013-02-03 12:10:58   +meskarune   with the new mail system, we can organize email and associated accounts better
2013-02-03 12:11:23        xrchz   I have no idea what agenda item 4 is about. Anyone who wants to raise something on it, go ahead.
2013-02-03 12:11:24   +meskarune   qubodup: heh, yes. constant server attacks means we can't have weak spots or lots of overhead :)
2013-02-03 12:11:46      qubodup   so "1 Members moderator request(s) waiting" is resolved?
2013-02-03 12:12:14        fsckd   xrchz: it's a joke. inserted into the proposed agenda this morning and somehow it stayed :P
2013-02-03 12:12:29        xrchz   let's move on to (5) then :)
2013-02-03 12:12:35        xrchz   which is Any Other Business
2013-02-03 12:12:38   +meskarune   we need to find a new platform for mailing list
2013-02-03 12:12:53   +meskarune   would be amazing if we could use the arch mailman :)
2013-02-03 12:12:53        xrchz   I suggest everyone look at http://titanpad.com/QCjfMjRuoP and pick an Action point to do.
2013-02-03 12:12:55        phrik   Title: TitanPad: QCjfMjRuoP (at titanpad.com)
2013-02-03 12:12:58        xrchz   some of them are done already - I will strikethrough..
2013-02-03 12:13:47   +meskarune   #1, we need someone to make the notes and add them to github meeting-notes.git
2013-02-03 12:14:02   +meskarune   we can then git pull on the server and they will be hosted online for *
2013-02-03 12:14:45   +meskarune   http://archwomen.org/media/meeting-notes
2013-02-03 12:15:07        phrik   Title: Index of /media/meeting-notes/ (at archwomen.org)
2013-02-03 12:15:21   +meskarune   all logs notes, etc are in /media as text files
2013-02-03 12:15:21     Nahlidge   I volunteer to write the notes on sticky-notes and take a very poorly lighted photo of them, and upload 'em to the server.
2013-02-03 12:15:39   +meskarune   Nahlidge: use instagram :)
2013-02-03 12:15:41      qubodup   I feel discomfort with "we have been hacked" being our motto.
2013-02-03 12:16:15   +meskarune   we can update that page
2013-02-03 12:16:26   +meskarune   hopefully the new blog will be up soon
2013-02-03 12:16:27      qubodup   on irc, website that seems to be the introduction
2013-02-03 12:16:33     Nahlidge   meskarune: just for you!
2013-02-03 12:17:06   +meskarune   we can change it to placeholder site or something 
2013-02-03 12:17:06        fsckd   we've been making a lot of progress with the server. slow but steady progress
2013-02-03 12:17:39   +meskarune   qubodup: people have been trying to get access to files on the webserver and constant ssh brute force attempts
2013-02-03 12:18:02        xrchz   right, but we don't have to keep saying it
2013-02-03 12:18:08   +meskarune   yeah
2013-02-03 12:18:09      qubodup   Is this an uncommon situation?
2013-02-03 12:18:31        xrchz   my server gets ssh brute force all the time as well - i think it's pretty common
2013-02-03 12:18:48   +meskarune   ssh brute force is common
2013-02-03 12:19:03   +meskarune   targeted hack attempts on webserver not so much
2013-02-03 12:19:10        xrchz   Nahlidge: so you're going to turn the titanpad notes into the meeting notes?
2013-02-03 12:19:12   +meskarune   I'm waiting for a DoS next
2013-02-03 12:19:20        fsckd   scary ><
2013-02-03 12:19:30     Nahlidge   xrchz: I was being funny, I'm just watching.
2013-02-03 12:19:33   +meskarune   we might have to look into DoS mitigation
2013-02-03 12:19:36        xrchz   Nahlidge: go ahead it's easy
2013-02-03 12:19:56     Nahlidge   xrchz: Sunday is my lazy-day.
2013-02-03 12:20:08      qubodup   so what about us getting this email daily "1 Members moderator request(s) waiting" ?
2013-02-03 12:20:16      qubodup   It links to http://archwomen.org/mailman/admindb/members_archwomen.org
2013-02-03 12:20:23   +meskarune   I need to cancel all the arvixe hosting stuff
2013-02-03 12:20:28        fsckd   asap
2013-02-03 12:20:38        fsckd   ಠ_ಠ
2013-02-03 12:20:52        fsckd   :P
2013-02-03 12:20:53   +meskarune   I have the mail archive I need to upload, and I need to download the mailing list archive
2013-02-03 12:21:00        fsckd   ok
2013-02-03 12:21:02      qubodup   is anybody taking care of 'rescuing' lost data (blog posts, images)?
2013-02-03 12:21:13   +meskarune   and cancel. they don't give refunds, but their hosting isn't secure at all
2013-02-03 12:21:18        xrchz   I'm afraid I have somewhere else to be now, so I need to hand over (or close the meeting)
2013-02-03 12:21:28   +meskarune   qubodup: the database is on the server, and in /media the images are there
2013-02-03 12:21:36        fsckd   xrchz: sure
2013-02-03 12:21:48   +meskarune   xrchz: we could probably end :)
2013-02-03 12:22:09   +meskarune   been an hour and a half
2013-02-03 12:22:15        xrchz   all right cool - thanks. remember the main message of getting people to use redmine between meetings :)
2013-02-03 12:22:21   +meskarune   :D
2013-02-03 12:22:22   +meskarune   yes
2013-02-03 12:22:28   +meskarune   so meeting ends NOW
2013-02-03 12:22:34        fsckd   *****************  archlinux women meeting is ended  **************

2013-05-05 12:06:09	-->	KylieBrooks (~kvirc@unaffiliated/kyliebrooks) has joined #archlinux-women
2013-05-05 12:06:10	+tigrmesh	meeting notes are at https://pad.riseup.net/p/gSlgsPDOyDNC
2013-05-05 12:06:13	phrik	Title: Riseup Pad (at pad.riseup.net)
2013-05-05 12:09:10	+meskarune	So status updates
2013-05-05 12:11:19	+tigrmesh	i guess fsckd is up
2013-05-05 12:12:07	fsckd	yes i am :D
2013-05-05 12:12:24	fsckd	redmine was updated from 2.2.4 to 2.3.0
2013-05-05 12:12:48	fsckd	2.2.x branch looks like it'll be dead sooner or later. it can't use ruby2 for example
2013-05-05 12:12:50	+meskarune	and just an fyi for the channel, updating remine is a PITA, so fsckd deserves an awark
2013-05-05 12:12:51	+meskarune	award
2013-05-05 12:12:59	fsckd	lol thnaks
2013-05-05 12:13:13	fsckd	i'm working on a script/wizard to guide one through the process
2013-05-05 12:13:15	 *	kaictl gives fsckd and awark
2013-05-05 12:13:25	fsckd	!grab kaictl
2013-05-05 12:13:25	phrik	fsckd: Tada!
2013-05-05 12:14:49	fsckd	i guess i'll have more to say once the script is done
2013-05-05 12:15:01	fsckd	i can't make it painless but i'll try my best to get close

2013-05-05 12:16:24	+meskarune	awesome
2013-05-05 12:16:25	+meskarune	:)
2013-05-05 12:16:52	+meskarune	how does everyone feel about using redmine for project management?
2013-05-05 12:17:13	+meskarune	so far I like having a place to put to-do's and list projects and news
2013-05-05 12:17:26	fsckd	and wiki
2013-05-05 12:18:56	+meskarune	maybe git integration would be cool, but I don't know how much more complicated that would make redmine/gitolite
2013-05-05 12:19:32	fsckd	no need for that, github is sufficient imo
2013-05-05 12:19:36	+meskarune	kk
2013-05-05 12:19:56	+meskarune	so news
2013-05-05 12:20:05	+meskarune	we have a rapid ssl cert that is good for 4 years
2013-05-05 12:20:20	+meskarune	the certs are on the server, we just need to configure lighttpd 
2013-05-05 12:20:40	+meskarune	I haven't used commercial certs before
2013-05-05 12:20:47	+meskarune	so input/help with that would be much appreciated
2013-05-05 12:22:50	fsckd	interjection: will need to move redmine from a subdomain to a subdir of the main site so that it is covered by ssl. will work on that this week
2013-05-05 12:23:31	+meskarune	The website structure was changed a bit so subsections of the site are in subdirectories
2013-05-05 12:24:06	+meskarune	we will need to redirect all port 80 traffic to https and redirect the redmine subdirectory to archwomen.org/redmine
2013-05-05 12:25:36	+meskarune	does anyone have questions about the switch to SSL ?
2013-05-05 12:26:12	XReaper	i shouldn't be able to register tasteless domains
2013-05-05 12:26:17	XReaper	how is you lot going :)
2013-05-05 12:26:29	fsckd	XReaper: in the middle of a meeting

2013-05-05 12:29:11	+meskarune	hehe ok
2013-05-05 12:29:22	kaictl	for now...i guess we could do it, but i don't know.
2013-05-05 12:29:24	+meskarune	let us know if you need anything, volunteers, doc writers, etc
2013-05-05 12:29:34	kaictl	i may be afk

2013-05-05 12:32:37	kaictl	i don't think that's a problem, it's fine to write docs...it's just whether or not i'll be out of state...
2013-05-05 12:32:57	+meskarune	don't sweat it :) â™¥ we appreciate all of your work
2013-05-05 12:33:20	+meskarune	also congrats on your new job
2013-05-05 12:33:27	kaictl	you could still put the pdf on the site, or something
2013-05-05 12:33:32	 *	kaictl doesn't know if he has a job yet...
2013-05-05 12:33:52	kaictl	but thanks :>
2013-05-05 12:34:08	+meskarune	hehe
2013-05-05 12:34:13	+meskarune	ok thanks for the update :D
2013-05-05 12:34:33	kaictl	(ironically this may be the same reason why we postponed it the first time...just for me and not gtmanfred )

2013-05-05 12:36:35	+meskarune	any other news we need to announce?
2013-05-05 12:36:51	kaictl	don't think so. i haven't heard anything about new classrooms or anything...
2013-05-05 12:37:04	+meskarune	kk
2013-05-05 12:37:19	+meskarune	project discussion: 
2013-05-05 12:37:22	+meskarune	Internship
2013-05-05 12:37:52	+meskarune	We need to write up a job description with duties, etc
2013-05-05 12:38:07	+meskarune	as well as resources and what sorts of experiance you need and what you will learn, etc
2013-05-05 12:38:15	+meskarune	and then we can use that to post on sites
2013-05-05 12:38:49	+meskarune	http://careers.washington.edu/ifiles/all/files/docs/shared/Best_Practices_for_Internship_Programs_NACE.pdf
2013-05-05 12:38:51	kaictl	(we could possibly have something with us in the classroom when gtmanfred and i are settled)
2013-05-05 12:39:35	+meskarune	yeah, getting an intern who is studing teaching would be useful
2013-05-05 12:39:36	fsckd	in past discussion it was proposed joining a program like OPW
2013-05-05 12:39:41	+meskarune	and introduce them to new technologies
2013-05-05 12:40:08	fsckd	or GSOC
2013-05-05 12:40:33	+meskarune	yeah, that would be great
2013-05-05 12:40:46	fsckd	no harm in having more than one intership program, if possible

2013-05-05 12:41:19	kaictl	if we have mentors, we could have them do a classroom or two to get their stuff out to other people, too.

2013-05-05 12:41:30	phrik	Title: OutreachProgramForWomen - GNOME Live! (at live.gnome.org)
2013-05-05 12:41:50	+meskarune	we need someone to look into the application process and we need to write up what exactly the intern will do/learn :)
2013-05-05 12:41:55	+meskarune	kaictl: I think that is a great idea :)
2013-05-05 12:42:13	kaictl	well, i mean they're teaching anyway, may as well do a classroom.
2013-05-05 12:42:33	kaictl	(and they could have their interns help or do stuff too)
2013-05-05 12:43:44	fsckd	will the internship program be run by Arch Women or Arch Linux?
2013-05-05 12:43:48	fsckd	(or both?)
2013-05-05 12:44:25	kaictl	i'm guessing it would be arch women, honestly. if it goes well, they might pick it up...
2013-05-05 12:44:52	+meskarune	yeah
2013-05-05 12:45:01	+meskarune	we can start out with an internship program 
2013-05-05 12:45:18	+meskarune	and maybe work with someoen in Arch Linux to get an internship program for arch
2013-05-05 12:45:44	kaictl	well, probably fly the AW internships first as a test, then if that goes well start this up.
2013-05-05 12:45:46	+meskarune	it would be awesome to have that and then recruit women from arch women to be mentors, so the mentors are more diverse
2013-05-05 12:45:55	fsckd	what work can Arch Women offer?
2013-05-05 12:45:57	+meskarune	kaictl: sounds like a plan :)
2013-05-05 12:45:57	-->	carharttjimmy (~james@user-0c2hdh9.cable.mindspring.com) has joined #archlinux-women
2013-05-05 12:46:18	kaictl	meskarune: like any free software thing, having something that actually works is better than just an idea.
2013-05-05 12:46:26	fsckd	hehe true
2013-05-05 12:46:30	+meskarune	fsckd: good question :)
2013-05-05 12:47:34	+meskarune	we could have interns work on scripts and software 
2013-05-05 12:47:38	+meskarune	or site developement
2013-05-05 12:47:45	+meskarune	or outreach even
2013-05-05 12:47:53	+meskarune	outreach/martketing/meetups
2013-05-05 12:48:25	+meskarune	we could reach out to people studying teaching, non-profit, writing, comp-sci
2013-05-05 12:48:43	+meskarune	and we can take interns with an interest in computers who might not be super proficient just yet
2013-05-05 12:49:21	fsckd	should also talk to someone who has run an internship program and get their input/advice
2013-05-05 12:49:36	+meskarune	yes, great idea
2013-05-05 12:49:46	+meskarune	we could use some mentors/advisors of our own :)
2013-05-05 12:49:56	fsckd	haha :D
2013-05-05 12:50:42	fsckd	someone should make an internship for people who want to start and run an internship program :P
2013-05-05 12:51:32	+meskarune	haha
2013-05-05 12:52:03	kaictl	i heard you like internships, so i made an internship for your internships.
2013-05-05 12:52:15	kaictl	so you can intern while you internship.
2013-05-05 12:52:25	fsckd	lol
2013-05-05 12:52:34	fsckd	your mentor is a turtle :P
2013-05-05 12:52:38	kaictl	but what about the internships for the internship internship? 
2013-05-05 12:52:55	fsckd	don't worry, it's internships all the way down
2013-05-05 12:53:02	kaictl	mkay.
2013-05-05 12:54:01	+meskarune	is internship on redmine?
2013-05-05 12:54:29	+meskarune	can we add a doc for internships we could hold? anyone would be able to add to it

2013-05-05 13:03:56	+meskarune	ok, Let's talk about fundraising
2013-05-05 13:03:57	+meskarune	:)
2013-05-05 13:04:57	+meskarune	are there any companies that benifit from arch linux who might be interested in helping?
2013-05-05 13:05:58	-->	carharttjimmy (~james@user-0c2hdh9.cable.mindspring.com) has joined #archlinux-women
2013-05-05 13:06:03	fsckd	good question
2013-05-05 13:06:28	+meskarune	how would be find this out?
2013-05-05 13:06:56	fsckd	i have no idea
2013-05-05 13:07:10	kaictl	magic
2013-05-05 13:08:00	+tigrmesh	i think we'd be better off looking for companies who support women in tech
2013-05-05 13:08:13	+tigrmesh	how much money are we looking to raise?
2013-05-05 13:08:19	kaictl	most likely. 
2013-05-05 13:09:17	+meskarune	I would say vps hosting companies who offer arch linux hosting, maybe the gnome/kde projects or FOSS related organizations
2013-05-05 13:09:43	+meskarune	tigrmesh: yeah, setting a goal would be good
2013-05-05 13:10:34	<--	carharttjimmy (~james@user-0c2hdh9.cable.mindspring.com) has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2013-05-05 13:11:21	+tigrmesh	are we just looking to cover our expenses, such as our email, ssl, and such?  of course we don't need to pay for a vps for now, so that wouldn't be included
2013-05-05 13:12:07	+meskarune	tigrmesh: yeah, and maybe we could also use some money for outreach
2013-05-05 13:12:19	+meskarune	or sending someone to speak 
2013-05-05 13:12:39	+meskarune	maybe lets say like, $500 or $1000 ?
2013-05-05 13:12:44	+tigrmesh	outreach?  in what way?
2013-05-05 13:13:50	+meskarune	we can host meetups
2013-05-05 13:13:57	+tigrmesh	ah
2013-05-05 13:14:15	+meskarune	and get the word out 
2013-05-05 13:14:56	+meskarune	honestly I think if we have some funds, we will find uses for them that will benifit Arch Women and Arch Linux tangenitally
2013-05-05 13:16:01	+meskarune	So the homepage we should have project goals, resources, what we do, etc and future plans/goals
2013-05-05 13:16:15	+meskarune	so we have a place to point people when we ask "would you like to sponsor us?"
2013-05-05 13:16:47	+meskarune	maybe first meetup can be in NYC ?
2013-05-05 13:16:58	fsckd	why nyc?
2013-05-05 13:17:15	+meskarune	hacker school is there and they have an outreach program
2013-05-05 13:17:19	fsckd	ahh
2013-05-05 13:17:37	+meskarune	and its pretty accessible as well with transportation going in
2013-05-05 13:17:59	+meskarune	but that doesn't have to be set, its just an idea :)
2013-05-05 13:18:43	fsckd	traffic is killer :P
2013-05-05 13:19:11	XReaper	literally
2013-05-05 13:19:13	XReaper	>.>
2013-05-05 13:19:18	fsckd	lol
2013-05-05 13:19:24	fsckd	meskarune: it's a nice idea, should meetups be a project of its own?
2013-05-05 13:20:09	+meskarune	fsckd: oh good idea! or it could be under outreach? idk
2013-05-05 13:20:43	+meskarune	maybe we could get github to sponsor some things for us since we use them and its good advertising for them
2013-05-05 13:21:22	fsckd	hmm

2013-05-05 13:24:11	+meskarune	maybe we should get someone specifically to help with the organization of outreach?
2013-05-05 13:24:38	+meskarune	recruite moar :)
2013-05-05 13:24:46	fsckd	heh
2013-05-05 13:25:48	+meskarune	ok now lets discuss the blog
2013-05-05 13:25:49	+meskarune	:)
2013-05-05 13:25:55	fsckd	:D
2013-05-05 13:26:02	+meskarune	we need to get it into a git repo, and everyone can push to it :)
2013-05-05 13:26:17	+meskarune	a few things we need to do: convert old posts to markdown blog format
2013-05-05 13:26:23	+meskarune	finish templates
2013-05-05 13:26:33	+meskarune	work on auto twitter thing
2013-05-05 13:26:43	+meskarune	(which doesn't hard with python-twitter)
2013-05-05 13:27:16	+meskarune	and maybe have a site so people can submit drafts to the server from a browser
2013-05-05 13:27:39	 *	MarkDude would be willing to have some materials at my FOSS events
2013-05-05 13:27:48	+meskarune	sweet :D
2013-05-05 13:27:49	MarkDude	For NorCal
2013-05-05 13:28:20	 *	MarkDude also brings UW materials as well as OpenSource.com and things like that
2013-05-05 13:28:58	 *	MarkDude sees a fair amount of people getting tired in their project, and wanting to go elsewhere
2013-05-05 13:29:08	MarkDude	Most are NOT interested in Fedora
2013-05-05 13:29:40	 *	MarkDude feels very comfortable pointing people to Arch (now that I understand a bit more about it)
2013-05-05 13:29:40	kaictl	is AW going to use any git frontend?
2013-05-05 13:30:18	+meskarune	MarkDude: that would be amazing
2013-05-05 13:30:29	+meskarune	And we would really appreciate it
2013-05-05 13:30:56	+meskarune	MarkDude: materials as in like, flyers?
2013-05-05 13:31:02	MarkDude	Yes
2013-05-05 13:31:03	+meskarune	kaictl: git frontend ?
2013-05-05 13:31:11	+meskarune	kaictl: like a web frontend?
2013-05-05 13:31:12	kaictl	meskarune: something like cgit/gitweb ?
2013-05-05 13:31:34	+meskarune	right now all of our public repos are on github 
2013-05-05 13:32:13	+meskarune	cgit works with gitolite
2013-05-05 13:32:19	kaictl	ah, right.
2013-05-05 13:32:20	+meskarune	and its static html
2013-05-05 13:32:21	+meskarune	:)
2013-05-05 13:32:25	kaictl	well, anything works with gitolite. lol
2013-05-05 13:32:27	+meskarune	lol
2013-05-05 13:32:34	kaictl	(i would recommend cgit, though)
2013-05-05 13:33:24	+meskarune	so people can see our repos on the server or on github?
2013-05-05 13:33:52	kaictl	ya.
2013-05-05 13:34:07	kaictl	(also, no ruby in that.)

2013-05-05 13:35:12	kaictl	ya, it's super easy to set up.
2013-05-05 13:36:12	+meskarune	so advantages of having a git web frontend vs. just github? :)
2013-05-05 13:36:32	+meskarune	can we have git updates in an rss?
2013-05-05 13:36:32	kaictl	if github goes down or the hooks stop working, people can still see the actual stuff.
2013-05-05 13:36:44	kaictl	i believe you can have them in an atom feed...and i think rss.
2013-05-05 13:37:23	kaictl	all i see in the man page is `max-atom-items`, so yeah.
2013-05-05 13:37:57	+meskarune	good points
2013-05-05 13:38:28	fsckd	github also has rss iirc
2013-05-05 13:38:59	+meskarune	we can add a link to the git rss feed to the site
2013-05-05 13:39:00	 *	kaictl hasn't seen any atom stuff on his cgit.
2013-05-05 13:39:21	+meskarune	on my homepage I have a javascript thingy that shows rss feeds
2013-05-05 13:40:19	kaictl	(but yeah, i think gitweb has some rss stuff, but it's like, 100x more resource intensive, and that much slower.
2013-05-05 13:40:27	+meskarune	oh I see
2013-05-05 13:40:59	fsckd	i can find rss feeds for individual branches in GitHub
2013-05-05 13:41:17	fsckd	not quite what we want
2013-05-05 13:41:58	+meskarune	we can research it more. but if we are using git as our main way to update things, an rss feed will be useful
2013-05-05 13:42:07	fsckd	yeah
2013-05-05 13:42:20	kaictl	there's probably some hooks magic you could do to make an rss feed...
2013-05-05 13:42:37	fsckd	hmm. ok...
2013-05-05 13:42:53	kaictl	idk. you can still keep things on github
2013-05-05 13:43:54	fsckd	if anyone wants to help, make a bash function which outputs commits in atom :D
2013-05-05 13:44:25	kaictl	i beleive cgit does that for you...
2013-05-05 13:45:24	fsckd	iiuc, if you have a github account, you can make a general rss feed
2013-05-05 13:46:29	kaictl	you can make one from your news feed, methinks.
2013-05-05 13:47:40	+meskarune	maybe when we make a python script for makign the site rss, we can adapt it for other things?
2013-05-05 13:47:42	+meskarune	:)
2013-05-05 13:47:51	+meskarune	fun python project idea
2013-05-05 13:47:52	kaictl	that would be cool.

2013-05-05 13:54:38	+meskarune	why are allies awesome, how it helps, how to be an ally, etc ?
2013-05-05 13:54:43	+meskarune	or maybe just a blog post on this topic
2013-05-05 13:54:54	+tigrmesh	blog post for starters
2013-05-05 13:55:00	+meskarune	but it might help people to understand more about what we do
2013-05-05 13:55:33	+tigrmesh	who will present the talk/be the face on the video?
2013-05-05 13:55:51	+tigrmesh	plus, i think the blog needs content

2013-05-05 14:01:19	kaictl	makes sense. i feel like we should try it out, at least.
2013-05-05 14:01:27	gtmanfred	indeed
2013-05-05 14:01:38	+meskarune	last day of class would be a google hangout ;P

2013-05-05 14:01:59	+meskarune	haha

2013-05-05 14:04:01	gtmanfred	we could probably stream skype

2013-05-05 14:06:02	+meskarune	because of a Xen bug that won't allow VPS to boot in certain sectors of ram
2013-05-05 14:06:20	gtmanfred	what are you doing?
2013-05-05 14:06:46	+meskarune	gtmanfred: need to change the 32 bit userspace to 64 bit

2013-05-05 14:08:03	gtmanfred	once for my netbook and once for my desktop
2013-05-05 14:08:03	gtmanfred	back when i had no clue what i was doing
2013-05-05 14:08:11	gtmanfred	the first time i installed arch i install i686

2013-05-05 14:08:47	gtmanfred	also, how are you booting 64bit and running all 32 bit programs? just installed the 64 bit kernel manually?
2013-05-05 14:08:58	+meskarune	its a vps
2013-05-05 14:09:06	+meskarune	so kernel and guest are sepperate things
2013-05-05 14:09:12	+meskarune	Xen 
2013-05-05 14:09:14	gtmanfred	OHHH 
2013-05-05 14:09:16	+meskarune	hehe
2013-05-05 14:09:19	gtmanfred	the host kernel is 64
2013-05-05 14:09:28	gtmanfred	i thought you were saying you installed 64 bit kernel on the guest
2013-05-05 14:09:29	kaictl	ah
2013-05-05 14:09:33	gtmanfred	yeah i can do that easily

2013-05-05 14:09:58	+meskarune	gtmanfred: is doing that goign to affect redmine?
2013-05-05 14:10:11	gtmanfred	hrm?
2013-05-05 14:10:14	+tigrmesh	can't we just tar everything, copy it somewhere else, then copy it back?  do the files care whether it's 32 bit or 64?
2013-05-05 14:10:18	gtmanfred	it will probably be down for a bit
2013-05-05 14:10:39	+meskarune	kk

2013-05-05 14:10:57	+meskarune	gtmanfred: yeah
2013-05-05 14:11:29	gtmanfred	do that, gimme 30 minutes, and then i can tell you more

2013-05-05 14:24:37	+meskarune	gtmanfred: making test server nao
2013-05-05 14:24:56	fsckd	which leads to the question, what work could a-w offer?

2013-05-05 14:34:37	MarkDude	Ananconda will be awesome
2013-05-05 14:34:49	gtmanfred	minus the fact that kde went from 4.10 on fedora 18 to 4.9.5 on fedora 19... everything went smoothly
2013-05-05 14:34:56	gtmanfred	MarkDude: it is awesome, right now
2013-05-05 14:35:00	gtmanfred	it wasn't on 18, but it is on 19
2013-05-05 14:35:10	gtmanfred	i just used it the other day
2013-05-05 14:35:13	MarkDude	the timing of it being done ended up with 19 being the one
2013-05-05 14:35:23	MarkDude	There was confusion about 18
2013-05-05 14:35:29	gtmanfred	yar
2013-05-05 14:35:30	MarkDude	gtmanfred: you are right tho
2013-05-05 14:35:46	 *	MarkDude is working on a remix that makes Gnome3 suck less
2013-05-05 14:35:51	gtmanfred	16 -> 17 was a nightmare because they did the /lib -> usr/lib symlink in initramfs
2013-05-05 14:35:54	fsckd	ok, time to end the meeting
2013-05-05 14:36:06	gtmanfred	which was amazing, but screwed up A LOT of systems, which is why only a reinstall was actually supported
2013-05-05 14:36:09	MarkDude	f14 was a peak in awesomeness- as well as numbers of download
2013-05-05 14:36:13	fsckd	*************** Meeting is Over ****************

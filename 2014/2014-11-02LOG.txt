Log of Arch Women 32nd IRC Meeting, November 2nd, 2014

16:10:34	fsckd	******************** Meeting Begins ********************
16:11:41	fsckd	first thing first, we have a new op, escondida!
16:12:17	fsckd	she is also op in -classroom
16:12:54	+meskarune	\o/
16:16:14	fsckd	she wields the mystical and ancient Golden Banhammer; passed in line from women to women from ages long since removed from human memory. her power is absolute and all will tremble before her might! for she is Thor incarnated!
16:16:22	fsckd	muahahaha! glory!
16:16:32	fsckd	err... sorry, got a bit carried away
16:16:39	fsckd	anywho
16:17:09	demize	Hm
16:17:26	demize	does that mean that vod1k is a woman?
16:17:39	demize	"passed in line from women to women"...
16:17:52	fsckd	no. vod1k is an artificial construct
16:17:58	demize	Ah, I see.
16:18:30	fsckd	he was created to serve sangria but by chance filled in a temporary gap :)
16:18:30	demize	But yay.. too bad she's not on ATM.
16:18:50	demize	Fate, ey.
16:19:05	fsckd	aye, works in mysterious ways
16:20:13	fsckd	that's all the announcement for this month
16:20:22	fsckd	meeting over, bye folks :)
16:20:23	demize	mmm...
16:20:24	fsckd	j/k
16:20:25	demize	;p
16:20:43	+meskarune	haha
16:20:58	demize	halosghost: You about?~
16:20:59	fsckd	our friend halosghost is working on two classes
16:21:40	fsckd	halosghost: any progress?
16:21:54	halosghost	demize: I am
16:22:17	halosghost	fsckd: I'm afraid, having started a full-time job since the last meeting, that I have made very little progress
16:22:38	fsckd	oh, it's good to have a job :)
16:22:45	halosghost	additionally, I did not receive very much feedback on the preliminary draft syllabus I posted for the static-typing class
16:22:58	halosghost	fsckd: indeed it is, but 49 hours a week does take a lot of my spare time away
16:23:02	demize	Should put out some ads in #archlinux{,-offtopic} for people wanting to teach a class :p
16:23:18	demize	halosghost: I think I must have missed that..
16:23:29	halosghost	here let me reupload it
16:23:41	fsckd	was it this http://ix.io/eDr ?
16:24:07	fsckd	for the class on datatypes
16:24:08	halosghost	fsckd: http://ix.io/eDr/rst
16:24:12	halosghost	fsckd: indeed it was :P
16:24:18	fsckd	hehe :)
16:24:39	halosghost	also, I just saw a typo that I'm gonna fix
16:24:49	fsckd	:)
16:24:58	demize	'languages¹' there's no citation or reference o.o
16:24:59	+meskarune	demize: I feel like there would be a ton of volunteers for "trolling 101" from -offtopic ;)
16:25:07	demize	meskarune: yeah >.>
16:25:21	halosghost	demize: yep, it's preliminary :P
16:25:26	+meskarune	I am interested in learning about datatypes
16:25:28	+meskarune	sounds fun
16:25:38	halosghost	demize: eventually, all the footnotes will be added
16:25:43	demize	mmm...
16:25:45	halosghost	in fact, I'll see if I can't do that now
16:26:12	 *	meskarune gives halosghost a cookie
16:26:30	halosghost	heh
16:26:48	demize	(also, if you host it on gists you can get the rst rendered ;p)
16:26:52	demize	also clone/push to it
16:26:56	demize	because woo, git
16:27:06	fsckd	+1
16:28:31	halosghost	demize: the ix isn't a hosting choice, just a way for the preliminary draft to be viewed
16:28:38	halosghost	demize: I'll probably end up hosting this on my website
16:28:41	halosghost	when it's ready
16:28:49	demize	Yeah, and I meant the same use of gists
16:28:57	halosghost	ahh
16:28:58	demize	there you can get diffs, and it rendered ;p
16:29:05	demize	also embed elsewhere
16:29:12	halosghost	good idea
16:29:21	halosghost	after the footnotes are added, I'll put it on a gist
16:29:37	demize	\o/
16:29:50	fsckd	:)
16:31:11	fsckd	when you put it in a gist (if you choose to), i'll post a link on the forums to ask for feedback
16:31:47	fsckd	or, you can post a link yourself :P
16:31:50	demize	One thing I miss in gists from regular repos are commenting on specific lines in a change
16:32:40	halosghost	fsckd: I'll leave that to you :)
16:32:51	halosghost	I'm writing out the footnote explanations now
16:33:18	+meskarune	thanks halosghost <333
16:33:24	halosghost	❤
16:33:45	+meskarune	I know a class is a lot of work, so take your time and maybe we can drum up some help for you
16:33:56	fsckd	+1
16:34:09	+meskarune	I'm sure your class will be really popular, we have had great turn out on the other classes :D
16:34:15	fsckd	indeed
16:35:06	fsckd	take your time and get it to the quality you want it to be :)
16:35:29	demize	^__^
16:37:35	halosghost	thanks all!
16:37:48	halosghost	the static typing class, I don't think will actually take too much more work
16:37:49	demize	halosghost: ❤
16:37:56	halosghost	the C class, however, will be a much more thorough ordeal
16:39:19	fsckd	i can imagine
16:39:43	fsckd	i'm glad you want to be thorough :)
16:40:49	demize	halosghost: Do tell if you want some advertisement for help~
16:41:45	jy2wong	halosghost: if you need a hand with the C class, let me know?
16:44:31	 *	meskarune doesn't know anything about C
16:45:48	halosghost	demize, jy2wong: I shall! For the moment, I'm focusing on the static typing class since it may be considered a "soft" pre-requisite for the C class
16:45:52	halosghost	also
16:45:54	halosghost	gist incoming
16:45:56	demize	Yeah \o
16:46:14	demize	We love you for working on it, even if you can't spend too much time on it :D
16:46:31	halosghost	heh
16:47:34	halosghost	ugh, copying into gist…
16:48:59	fsckd	𝓱𝓪𝓵𝓸𝓼𝓰𝓱𝓸𝓼𝓽 𝓲𝓼 𝓪𝔀𝓮𝓼𝓸𝓶𝓮
16:50:02	+meskarune	halosghost: yeah, I wish that were better, I always have problems copying into gists
16:50:20	halosghost	gist: https://gist.github.com/HalosGhost/aaf5ea068ef0f2854a3c
16:50:21	phrik	Title: The skeleton / syllabus of a short IRC class on Static Typing (at gist.github.com)
16:51:03	fsckd	nice :D
16:51:15	halosghost	seems one of my footnotes wasn't rendered correctly
16:51:17	 *	halosghost fixes
16:51:28	halosghost	…
16:51:39	halosghost	seems none of my footnotes were rendered correctly in-line
16:51:46	halosghost	welp, I don't know how to fix that :P
16:53:35	+meskarune	hehe
16:53:40	+meskarune	good enough for gov work
16:54:10	halosghost	it's a good start at least
16:54:32	halosghost	if only gists had PRs
16:54:40	halosghost	comments welcome!
16:54:54	+meskarune	yes, it is! :D
16:55:01	+meskarune	so for class stuff
16:55:15	+meskarune	haloghost has a gist, and needs some comments
16:55:20	+meskarune	so we can spam the link around
16:55:35	+meskarune	anything else for classroom?
16:57:53	+meskarune	next agenda item is google summer of code
16:58:36	fsckd	i found a couple of links to help
16:58:51	+meskarune	there doesn't seem to be a ton of interest from the devs, besides like, allan
16:58:57	fsckd	FAQ: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2014/help_page
16:58:58	phrik	Title: Google Summer of Code 2014 Frequently Asked Questions (at www.google-melange.com)
16:59:12	fsckd	Mentor Manual: http://en.flossmanuals.net/gsocmentoring/
16:59:13	phrik	Title: Mentors Guide (at en.flossmanuals.net)
17:04:40	fsckd	found through this blog post: http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2014/02/mentoring-organization-applications-now.html
17:04:42	phrik	Title: Google Open Source Blog: Mentoring Organization Applications Now Being Accepted for Google Summer of Code 2014! (at google-opensource.blogspot.com)
17:05:33	+meskarune	oh nice
17:05:59	fsckd	one thing i noticed is the requirement for organization admin
17:06:03	demize	halosghost: https://gist.github.com/kyrias/4f5ac27ee8d04720492c 
17:06:04	phrik	Title: static_typing_class.rst (at gist.github.com)
17:06:12	demize	halosghost: Need a space before, like with all other markup
17:06:17	demize	tho the links fail ;p
17:06:30	jy2wong	halosghost: for the data representation section, do you want to get into endianness? You're assuming little-endian for 0x7f800000 being interpreted as a large number
17:06:57	fsckd	the org admin leads the GSoC stuff for the project
17:07:15	halosghost	jy2wong: I'll add a note about it, but the class isn't really about machine-level representation, that's just a part of it
17:08:03	halosghost	demize: the links fail?
17:08:11	fsckd	meskarune: the org admin would have some authority over the mentors. would have to be a dev. can't be AW. iiuc
17:08:47	jy2wong	halosghost: yeah, IMO endianness doesn't warrant more than a "caution! here's a wikipedia link" but it's probably worth mentioning.
17:08:47	+meskarune	fsckd: Oh I see
17:08:48	demize	halosghost: clicking the links reloads the page and doesn't move you down to them.
17:08:51	+meskarune	so we need to recruit
17:09:05	halosghost	oh
17:09:14	halosghost	jy2wong: definitely!
17:09:19	halosghost	jy2wong: I'll add it momentarily
17:09:48	halosghost	demize: either way, the footnotes are fixed :P
17:10:56	fsckd	meskarune: need to get more devs on board. AW can do the research on setting up a GSoC program in Arch. and present it to the devs. but it would need to be the devs who run it and do the work
17:11:15	+meskarune	yeah, and I know the devs are very busy
17:11:35	demize	meskarune for dev!
17:11:46	fsckd	+100 XD
17:12:31	+meskarune	I gotta get better at programming :3
17:12:38	halosghost	jy2wong: link added
17:12:49	+meskarune	I think I know more theory than practice
17:12:49	demize	meskarune: Don't need to be a programmer to be an Arch dev :p
17:13:07	fsckd	just need to be good at breaking things :P
17:13:21	demize	I should become an Arch dev too then ;p
17:13:31	demize	I'm fully qualified for breaking things!
17:13:36	fsckd	haha
17:13:44	fsckd	demize for dev!
17:14:14	demize	Well, unfortunately we'd need to get the devs on board and they'd need to chose to make me a dev, and that feels rather unlikely :p
17:14:26	fsckd	hmm...
17:15:00	demize	coup d'etat?
17:15:08	fsckd	oh good idea!
17:15:20	+meskarune	 demize orly?
17:15:27	 *	fsckd raises the banners of war! "We will march to Canada and throw down those fat taco eating slobs. We will usher a new era in Arch. For glory!"
17:15:28	+meskarune	is arch dev mostly packaging?
17:15:37	demize	meskarune: Pretty much..
17:16:01	demize	hmm...
17:16:16	demize	Allan was on an hour ago...
17:16:25	demize	left around the same time the meeting started
17:16:27	demize	too bad...
17:16:31	fsckd	yeah
17:16:33	--	numie is now known as numeral
17:16:52	halosghost	meskarune: and bug fixing on packaging
17:16:55	halosghost	meskarune: pretty much
17:18:41	halosghost	I've considered signing up for TUship before
17:18:48	halosghost	I still might
17:18:49	demize	Doo eet!
17:18:58	+meskarune	I've been trying to package more on the AUR
17:19:12	demize	I wish I had packages that would be worth enough to get into the repos ;p
17:19:18	+meskarune	I think some of hte really outdated packages should be removed though :/
17:19:19	halosghost	don't know if they'd be interested in accepting someone whose interest area would be "bring MOAR games and haskelly things to the repos"
17:19:44	fsckd	(i am pretty sure most of the devs are in EU or US. any war party seeking to usurp power by going to Canada will be disappointed and will probably freeze to death before they can accomplish anything)
17:19:49	+meskarune	I just recently found out that creatures works on linux
17:19:49	halosghost	either way, my interest area for TUship is ot for the meeting
17:20:19	+meskarune	lol fsckd 
17:20:24	demize	halosghost: Well, games they most likely would be.
17:20:32	demize	fsckd: ;)
17:20:43	demize	fsckd: I'm Swedish, not German.
17:21:44	+meskarune	as an american... what is the difference?
17:21:46	+meskarune	trolololol
17:21:50	fsckd	:P
17:22:32	demize	:p
17:23:19	demize	(It was a reference to the German soldiers freezing to death when they tried to invade Russia)
17:23:38	demize	I mean, it's horrible, but it's also a bit amusing.
17:23:47	demize	But that's okay, because I'm a horrible person.
17:23:49	fsckd	heh
17:25:28	fsckd	demize would be the sole survivor of our failed invasion of Canada. he'd be seen walking along the banks of the Arctic Ocean in swimwear. "ten below zero is good beach weather" :P
17:25:45	+meskarune	so we have the infos, maybe can post to mailing list and forums again and see who responds
17:25:46	 *	demize smirks
17:25:51	+meskarune	or maybe we could get allan to
17:26:09	demize	meskarune: Might get more response if Allan posts to arch-dev-public
17:26:19	+meskarune	I wouldn't make it past 20ft from my door. Its so cold outside T_T
17:26:32	fsckd	forums are not a place many devs are found in
17:28:42	demize	heh..
17:29:02	+meskarune	I never seem to be on when allan is :/
17:29:06	demize	fsckd: To be fair tho, I don't swim, and I'm never ever seen in public in swimwear.
17:29:19	demize	meskarune: Well, you were earlier sorta :p
17:29:42	+meskarune	I can't take cold, but I am fine in heat
17:29:55	+meskarune	demize: lol
17:30:07	demize	It's easier to put on more clothes and wrap yourself in blankets than getting cold.
17:30:19	demize	so I prefer cold over heat
17:30:23	demize	But I prefer neither.
17:30:30	demize	Autumn or spring is good.
17:30:45	jy2wong	(is the meeting over, or just very off-topic right now? :P)
17:30:55	demize	Well
17:30:55	fsckd	very offtopic right now :P
17:31:15	demize	Not *that* off topic...
17:31:19	demize	;p
17:32:13	+meskarune	ok, so decision for GSOC - we need to get devs involved, maybe has allan make a post to the mailing list
17:32:20	+meskarune	if he is still interested in being involved
17:32:44	fsckd	how about if you talk to him. we can't make much progress until then
17:33:17	fsckd	i suggest emailing him your ideas or scheduling a time to tlak on IRC
17:33:22	fsckd	talk*
17:34:20	demize	That's an excellent idea.
17:35:41	+meskarune	ok :)
17:39:04	fsckd	so is that it, anything else on internship?
17:42:11	+meskarune	I think thats all
17:42:44	fsckd	ok
17:42:53	fsckd	any final comments of questions?
17:42:58	fsckd	or*
17:45:26	fsckd	ok then, by the authority invested in me by the Arch Linux Women project, i hereby declare
17:45:36	fsckd	******************** Meeting Ends ********************

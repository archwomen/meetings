Log of Arch Women 23rd IRC Meeting, January 5th, 2014

Jan 05 12:26:06  +meskarune  ======= Meeting Starts =======
Jan 05 12:26:14  +meskarune  so its a new year, yay!
Jan 05 12:26:29  +meskarune  we had an install day in dec.
Jan 05 12:26:34  +meskarune  and got some members
Jan 05 12:27:07  +meskarune  trolls seem to have gone
Jan 05 12:27:37       fsckd  yeah, there was a sudden influx of trolls in nov. and early dec.
Jan 05 12:32:02       eviii  so what will be our milestones this year?
Jan 05 12:32:40      evilop  http://arch.har-ikkje.net/gfx/ke.jpg
Jan 05 12:32:44      evilop  that is my plan anyway
Jan 05 12:33:30       eviii   i think i will go into hiding this year /O.o\
Jan 05 12:35:26       fsckd  lol
Jan 05 12:36:05  +meskarune  maybe for this year, we can work on fundraising and getting the internship thing going
Jan 05 12:36:21  +meskarune  either getting involved with google summer of code or gnome outreach project thing
Jan 05 12:36:51  +meskarune  might be cool to have a presence at some conference also
Jan 05 12:40:07       fsckd  that's a good idea
Jan 05 12:40:26       eviii  which one?
Jan 05 12:40:57       fsckd  internship/GSOC/GnomeOPW
Jan 05 12:41:23       fsckd  and fundraising and conference
Jan 05 12:41:56       fsckd  i'd like to see some progress made with the intership thing
Jan 05 12:43:37  +meskarune  yeah, me too
Jan 05 12:43:56  +meskarune  maybe we should start with a plan, and find someone to be an advisor?
Jan 05 12:44:10  +meskarune  perhaps I can contact the ada initiative or something 
Jan 05 12:45:09       eviii  what to you want to do? Do you want to offer internships or are you searching for liasons
Jan 05 12:46:29  +meskarune  we want to have a paid internship 
Jan 05 12:46:36  +meskarune  maybe one over the summer or something
Jan 05 12:47:24  +meskarune  we all feel that unpaid internships are awful
Jan 05 12:47:40  +meskarune  and exclude people who don't have the means to go 3 months without income
Jan 05 12:48:08       eviii  i agree.
Jan 05 12:48:12  +meskarune  :)
Jan 05 12:48:56  +meskarune  I'm not great at fundraising though
Jan 05 12:49:06  +meskarune  maybe we could have a wiki page to brainstorm
Jan 05 12:50:15       fsckd  i would like to help but i can't lead. i'm already busy with the server stuff (asides from everything going on in my own life)
Jan 05 12:50:17       eviii  yeah one for the fundraising and one for the task of the internship
Jan 05 12:51:00       eviii  i think without a proper task description it will be hard to fundraise anything
Jan 05 12:51:28    ladweeba  you could do crowdfunding or crowdsourcing using kickstart or indiegogo for funding
Jan 05 12:52:30       eviii  and i have no clue how much money one will need for a proper payment (including insurances, tax and stuff ...)
Jan 05 12:53:28  +meskarune  ladweeba: yeah, that might be a good option
Jan 05 12:53:36       eviii   aj you wrote on the homepage 3000$/year
Jan 05 12:53:41  +meskarune  but we'll need to drum up some hype and social media word of mouth
Jan 05 12:54:53       fsckd  eviii's suggestion of drafting a description of stuff is the first step imo
Jan 05 12:54:59  +meskarune  ++
Jan 05 12:55:15       fsckd  get an idea of what can be offered so when people ask there's something to say
Jan 05 12:55:24  +meskarune  yeah
Jan 05 13:07:15  +meskarune  ugh, spacing out
Jan 05 13:07:37       eviii  So what do you have in mind, what can be offered?
Jan 05 13:07:43  +meskarune  ok, so we need to plan fund raising, awareness and figure out the internship stuff as our goal for 2014
Jan 05 13:08:03  +meskarune  we could have a programming project
Jan 05 13:08:24  +meskarune  like working on the irc bot, or working on server tools, or maybe just adding features to the blog
Jan 05 13:08:45  +meskarune  we could also have marketing intern, or have someone do web developement
Jan 05 13:08:59  +meskarune  or they could teach a class through arch classroom
Jan 05 13:09:48       eviii  I'll like the idea with the arch classroom, cause it has these multiplier effect
Jan 05 13:09:51  +meskarune  might be fun to have a "let's learn python" class and people just gather together to learn to program 
Jan 05 13:10:55         -->  Chris_TR (~chris@187-178-35-237.dynamic.axtel.net) has joined #archlinux-women
Jan 05 13:11:03  +meskarune  yeah, and classroom can work with people with different skills
Jan 05 13:11:44  +meskarune  ps ya'll are being really helpful :)
Jan 05 13:11:58  +meskarune  so thanks :D
Jan 05 13:15:06       eviii  i liked the idea of railsgirls, that the learners can try and create their own projects through learning by doing and meet up again. The tutors helping them.
Jan 05 13:16:01         <--  Chris_TR (~chris@187-178-35-237.dynamic.axtel.net) has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
Jan 05 13:18:14  +meskarune  yeah, that is a great project
Jan 05 13:20:12       eviii  time is up for me and i have to say good bye. I would appreciate it, if links to the newly created wiki pages will be linked in the minutes protocol or posted here.
Jan 05 13:20:18       eviii  Have a good time byebye
Jan 05 13:21:22       fsckd  thanks eviii, will do
Jan 05 13:28:35         <--  eviii (~evi@2001:a60:1656:f901:c646:19ff:fe03:d29c) has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
Jan 05 13:31:34  +meskarune  I updated the riseup a bit
Jan 05 13:31:41  +meskarune  what else were we talking about?
Jan 05 13:31:43  +meskarune  ><
Jan 05 13:32:02  +meskarune  so we have some milestones for the year
Jan 05 13:32:33  +meskarune  need to do some basic planning and I'll try to contact someone about mentoring/questions
Jan 05 13:32:38  +meskarune  and for the month
Jan 05 13:37:29    ladweeba  btw, have you seen this site http://www.internmatch.com/?
Jan 05 13:37:31       phrik  Title: Find Internships | Intern Jobs | Paid Internships (at www.internmatch.com)
Jan 05 13:38:13    ladweeba  we think a lot, phrik
Jan 05 13:38:30    ladweeba  I mean alike
Jan 05 13:39:10    ladweeba  :)
Jan 05 13:39:36  +meskarune  oh cool
Jan 05 13:39:41  +meskarune  I haven't heard of it, thanks
Jan 05 13:42:26       fsckd  for this month, let's focus on getting the mailing list up
Jan 05 13:43:18       fsckd  need to have a way to converse without us all being on at the same time
Jan 05 13:43:34  +meskarune  yeeees
Jan 05 13:43:46  +meskarune  I wonder if there is anyone in #archlinux who could help out?
Jan 05 13:43:51  +meskarune  or maybe I can ask on the forums
Jan 05 13:43:57       fsckd  totally
Jan 05 13:44:35    ladweeba  what is the mailing list about?
Jan 05 13:45:46       fsckd  archwomen :P
Jan 05 13:46:10       fsckd  it's hard to get everyone in the channel at once to discuss stuff
Jan 05 13:46:13  +meskarune  ladweeba: basically so we can further discuss things in meetings, and have an archive
Jan 05 13:46:25  +meskarune  and people from different time zones can interact 
Jan 05 13:46:38       fsckd  some people live in opposite time zones
Jan 05 13:46:46           *  fsckd is slow today
Jan 05 13:46:51    ladweeba  right
Jan 05 13:46:54         -->  tigr (~tigrmesh@archlinux/op/tigrmesh) has joined #archlinux-women
Jan 05 13:46:54          --  Mode #archlinux-women [+v tigr] by ChanServ
Jan 05 13:47:00         <--  tigrmesh (~tigrmesh@archlinux/op/tigrmesh) has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
Jan 05 13:47:06    ladweeba  i mean right that people are in different time zones
Jan 05 13:47:22       fsckd  :P
Jan 05 13:47:31    ladweeba  that seems to be the case with most irc channels
Jan 05 13:48:47    ladweeba  i'm in the U.S., west coast myself
Jan 05 13:49:04       fsckd  good morning ^_^
Jan 05 13:49:16    ladweeba  it looks like people here are from EU, and lotsa different places
Jan 05 13:49:30    ladweeba  thank you, fsckd :)
Jan 05 13:49:48       fsckd  there are a few other people from the west coast who don't normally attend the meetings because it is too early for them
Jan 05 13:50:52          --  tigr is now known as tigrmash
Jan 05 13:51:12    ladweeba  i bet ...i just stumbled upon your meeting this morning...i was looking for a women's group to learn about linux so here i am...i would love to be a part of a linux community in order to keep learning
Jan 05 13:51:42       fsckd  glad you stopped by :)
Jan 05 13:51:49    ladweeba  i am too
Jan 05 13:55:42         <--  tigrmash (~tigrmesh@archlinux/op/tigrmesh) has quit (Quit: Leaving)
Jan 05 14:00:26    ladweeba  I had never ever heard of archlinux until this morning.
Jan 05 14:01:07       fsckd  oh, do you use linux?
Jan 05 14:02:03    ladweeba  No, it's a new thing for me.
Jan 05 14:02:33  +meskarune  oh nice :D
Jan 05 14:02:34    ladweeba  I figured if I want to learn it, then I should find a group that would help me along the way.
Jan 05 14:02:45         <--  psyl0n (~psyl0n@unaffiliated/psyl0n) has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jan 05 14:02:52  +meskarune  ladweeba: we have install days to help people install arch, and we held a package building class and do other events
Jan 05 14:03:04    ladweeba  ok
Jan 05 14:03:05  +meskarune  you are in good company :D
Jan 05 14:03:10    ladweeba  that sounds great
Jan 05 14:03:39    ladweeba  I was reading about it on line just now.
Jan 05 14:04:01         -->  tigrmesh (~tigrmesh@archlinux/op/tigrmesh) has joined #archlinux-women
Jan 05 14:04:01          --  Mode #archlinux-women [+v tigrmesh] by ChanServ
Jan 05 14:04:16    ladweeba  :)
Jan 05 14:04:39  +meskarune  how did you hear about us? :)
Jan 05 14:04:59    ladweeba  I did a search on searchirc
Jan 05 14:05:07  +meskarune  haha cool
Jan 05 14:05:17    ladweeba  I typed linux and women and you were in the results
Jan 05 14:07:41  +meskarune  there is also ubuntu-women and fedora-women and linux chix 
Jan 05 14:07:52  +meskarune  linux chix use their own server though
Jan 05 14:08:38  +meskarune  so I guess next thing on meeting, blog - lets keep updating, and if there have little news things or opinions they want to share, we would be happy to post them
Jan 05 14:08:51  +meskarune  and give link backs to author sites
Jan 05 14:09:09  +meskarune  "if there are people who have little news things"
Jan 05 14:09:19  +meskarune  I didn't get enough sleep last night
Jan 05 14:09:20  +meskarune  lol
Jan 05 14:09:48  +meskarune  ladweeba: have you used linux before?
Jan 05 14:10:07  +meskarune  er, well I guess you probably have, but on a desktop computer?
Jan 05 14:10:25  +meskarune  since like tons of mobile and tablet devices run linux
Jan 05 14:10:27       fsckd  hehe, linux is everywhere now
Jan 05 14:10:31  +meskarune  yeah lol
Jan 05 14:10:38    ladweeba  yes, at an internet cafe here...all the computers had a linux OS to save the cafe owner moolah
Jan 05 14:10:47  +meskarune  nice :)
Jan 05 14:11:20  +meskarune  its more secure too, free updates for life, and staying updated = way lower risk of getting hacked
Jan 05 14:11:24    ladweeba  one cafe used debian and another cafe used something different...all i did was use the internet
Jan 05 14:11:58    ladweeba  whenever a problem came up the internet cafe manager or owner fixed the issue.
Jan 05 14:12:12       fsckd  before i go, i just want to say, for the month goals, keep them few. cause, like we set 5 things and get only half of them done. keep stuff focused and get the important stuff done. every thing else should go in the todo on the wiki
Jan 05 14:12:25  +meskarune  fsckd: yeah :)
Jan 05 14:12:35  +meskarune  this month I want to finish up with munin
Jan 05 14:12:41  +meskarune  and work on the mailing list
Jan 05 14:13:00  +meskarune  and we can encourage people to help make ideas on teh wiki for fund raising and internship stuff
Jan 05 14:13:11  +meskarune  mailing list will help with planning and discussion
Jan 05 14:13:20  +meskarune  should we end the meeting? ;)
Jan 05 14:13:34    ladweeba  how do I get access to the wiki ...i would like to post a list of cf sites
Jan 05 14:13:59    ladweeba  cf = crowdfunding sites
Jan 05 14:14:18    ladweeba  it's a comparison of cfs
Jan 05 14:16:10  +meskarune  kk

   * Channel rules are linked to from the topic. https://archwomen.org/wiki/aw-org:irc
      * polyzen suggested: "If you make us feel bad about being smart." would be better as "If you insult our intelligence."
      * tigrmesh replied: it sounds like really low level language.  until you've gotten into wrangling with someone about whether something was an insult. and then there's phase 2, the exact meaning of "intelligence"

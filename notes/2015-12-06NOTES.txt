Topics for discussion
Community
* In the previous meeting polyzen suggested changing the file names of minutes to something shorter. GitHub is cutting off the names. Caveat: broken links.
  * After the meeting a name scheme was determined (to match the scheme used by logs): yyyy-mm-ddnotes.txt
  * a lighttpd rule to redirect older links to the newer scheme: “^(/media/meeting-notes/)archlinux-women_minutes_([0-9]{4})([0-9]{2})([0-9]{2}).txt” ⇒ “$1$2-$3-$4notes.txt” - todo
    * it uses perl regex http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/docs_modredirect


Classroom
* [halosghost] C programming class - [todo]
  * progress - secion 1-3 planned, need to work on 4-6
  * name - "C alice walk, C alice run" :P
* [escondida] Bash scripting and coreutils class - discuss
  * progress?
  * name?
* Classroom license, propose to use GFDL to match Arch Linux Wiki - have GFDL default and if teachers have strong preference they can pick another. CC0 is possibilty, probably compatible with GFDL.
  * https://archwomen.org/wiki/todo:classroom_license
  * Using the same license as the Arch Linux Wiki will allow information to flow between both projects easily.
  * Classroom cannot maintain tutorials. Either the Arch Linux Wiki can do that or a new wiki can be made for that. Don't duplicate effort.
  * Choosing a license is important and should be done before inviting people to make new classes.
  * Will need records of permission granteed from each past teacher: gtmanfred, kaictl, CalimeroTeknik, jy2wong, nisstyre, halosghost, and escondida. - [todo]

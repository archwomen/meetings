Arch Women 46th IRC meeting

The wiki is getting hit by a spammer. We currently have a simple CAPTCHA. We are using http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:captcha. Some ideas for countering the spam are,
	* stronger captcha, perhaps reCaptcha https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:recaptcha
	* blacklist certain topics https://www.dokuwiki.org/blacklist
	* move to OpenID
	* See also https://www.dokuwiki.org/antispam .

Classroom
	* C Programming class by halosghost - More feedback on the syllabus as it stands is welcome. https://ptpb.pw/r/~alcclass
	* Git Basics class by polyzen. https://pad.riseup.net/p/archlinux-git-class

Meetings
	* Renaming of meeting notes files still needs to be done. Any volunteers?
		* tigrmesh will talk to polyzen and get back to us.
		* When the files are renamed, fsckd will edit lighttpd's config so that the old URLs are redirected to the new names.
	* Need volunteers to help run meetings. Specifically we need people who can make log files and help draft meeting notes. Everything gets saved in git repositories.
		* Automate using a meeting bot.

Feedback on meeting
 * Meeting page on redmine should include who is discussing what at the meeting.
   * Add starting with next meeting's (April) agenda.
 * Move next meeting to separate meeting chan, or notify people who join #a-w that we are in a meeting.
   * From next meeting, topic will be changed to have the following information: meeting is progress, link to agenda, link to titanpad, and that the channel is being logged.

Something we've forgotten, and should do next time, is about setting up teams to do/break down specific projects.

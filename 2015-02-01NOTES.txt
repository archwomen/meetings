To talk about at the next meeting:

    * Google Hangouts (or any other platform, for that matter). It could be used for mentoring, for those monthly meetings, and this kind of stuff.

    * Meetings and classes should be held on a medium that is accessible (consider hard of hearing and visually impaired).

Arch Women IRC Meeting - 7th July 2013

Announcements and status updates
 * Server (blog, front page, etc.)
   * meskarune made a grid template system which can be used across various sections of the site (e.g. front page, Redmine).
   * Blog is up but still needs work - help is welcome.
     * There is a simple post submission page https://archwomen.org/test/submit/ . Post are placed into a directory for review (eventually have it managed by git). Anyone can contribute to the blog without needing to know how to use git.
 * IRC bot
   * Work is to progress in two stages - replace existing a-w bot and the logger, then replace phrik.

Topics for discussion
 * Discuss what needs to be done to achieve completion of the classroom.
   * Proposed time is the first week of August.
 * Replace redmine with a wiki and issue tracker.
   * Question: What issue tracker and wiki?
   * Considerations: Needs to be easy to administrate, light on resource usage, and generally secure.
   * Suggestions: Request tracker, moinmoin, gitit, dokuwiki
 * Internship (GSoC, OPW, what else?)
   * For doing code, web development, maybe writing, etc.
   * Need to define the program and requirements for applicants.
   * Get sponsors and apply to grants for funding.
 * Mentorship program goal and possibly details? Two main types possible
   * Arch based aimed for the Distro.
   * FOSS based approach. Let's get folks to use Linux and help point to Distro that suits them best. MarkDude would be able to help with this option. I (MarkDude) see the goal as getting more people involved that *play well with others* involved in FOSS.
   * Need to have a system in place for mentors and learners to network and communicate.
 * How do allies fit into Arch Women?
   * Men and women are equal in A-W; people are distinguished by how much they contribute. Guests are those who do not intend to stay long or participate.
   * Some men have a vested interest in benefiting women.
   * FOSS is mostly male, so it would make sense to have men involved and making changes within their own circles.
   * Everyone should try to be inclusive and understanding in channel. It is a safe place for many.
   * Help set an example for other men.
   * peace, love and coffee

Final comments, questions, etc.
 * Clarification of third point under "allies" above, "FOSS is mpstly male [...]."

    + Something that has a specific goal we can work toward and is quantifiable.
      - Something like "Help increase the community involvement of women in Arch Linux and FOSS though networking and learning."
      - With info on making women's contributions more visible.
    + Have a quick meeting to get it written up - a start on it is at https://pad.riseup.net/p/awmissionstate.
  * We'd like more blog posts from the community.
  * Recurring feature for blog / site: ask community members for 1 paragraph or so to answer 
    + "What arch women means to me." or 
    + "Why I participate in arch women."

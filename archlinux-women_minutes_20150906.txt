Arch Linux Women - September 6, 2015 IRC Meeting

Announcements and status updates
    * Recieved some donations from some generous people, enough to cover domain name renewals and SSL cert.

Topics for discussion
Server
    * New password system is go!

Website
    * SSL Certificate:
        * Free issuer? StartSSL isn't supported widely
            * WoSign https://www.wosign.com/english/freeSSL.htm (thanks to demize)
            * https://letsencrypt.org/ - possibly too new, but good to keep an eye on

Classroom:
    * halosghost is interested in doing a C programming class
        * jy2wong would be happy to help out
        * Start up a mailing list thread on the C class so people can keep up with the news

Mentorship:
    * Wiki page setup, maybe we can get volunteer writers?
    * Use an intermediary between mentors and mentee, to prevent abuses
        * Questionnaire, inspired from other mentor programs
        * Also check out whether the mentors and mentees have a website available, e.g for projects they have worked on?
    * Add link/line to Arch site/wiki
        * Suggested page: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Getting_involved#Community_projects

Community
    * Host another Arch Install day?
        * Saturday, September 26th

Final comments, questions, etc.
